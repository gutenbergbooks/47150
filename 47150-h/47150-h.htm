<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In the pages that follow, I make no attempt to supply
a consecutive and comprehensive history of English
stage travestie. This would have been impossible within
the limits assigned to me. My object has been simply
to furnish an introduction to such a history, supplemented
by sketches of the various groups into which English stage
burlesques naturally fall, with such extracts as might serve
to exhibit the respective methods of individual travestie-writers.
My business has been with the literary rather
than the histrionic side of <span class="nwrp">burlesque&mdash;with</span> the witty and
humorous, rather than the purely theatrical, features of
the subject with which I had to deal. At the same
time, I hope that the details I have been able to give
concerning dates, and "casts," and so on, may be useful
to at least a large section of my readers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I ought to say that, while I have endeavoured to
mention all the most representative burlesques of which
our stage history keeps record, I have intentionally left
outside of my scheme all "extravaganzas," "bouffoneries
musicales," and other such miscellaneous varieties of comic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
literature,&mdash;confining myself to definite and deliberate
travesties of subjects previously existent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have to thank more than one kind friend for information
and material supplied, and more than one living writer
of burlesque for the opportunity of consulting his "prompt
books" and thus quoting from unpublished work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Those who desire to extend their acquaintance with the
literature of English stage burlesque may be recommended to
turn first to the travesties published by Mr. French, which include
those by Planché, and many by the Broughs, H. J. Byron,
Talfourd, F. C. Burnand, etc. Mr. Gilbert's "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern" is to be found in his volume entitled "Foggerty's
Fairy, and Other Stories." A large proportion of the burlesques
discussed, quoted, or mentioned in the following chapters are out
of print, and to be seen only at the British Museum, on the second-hand
bookstalls, or on the shelves of private collectors.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="I" id="I">I.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE BEGINNINGS OF BURLESQUE.</p>



<p>Who shall say when the spirit of burlesque first made
its appearance on our stage? There were traces
of it, we may be sure, in the Mysteries and Moralities
of pre-Elizabethan days; the monkish dramatists were not
devoid of humour, and the first lay playwrights had a rough
sense of ridicule. The "Vice" which figured in so many of
our rude old dramas had in him an element of satire, and
the pictures drawn of his Satanic Majesty were conscious
or unconscious caricatures of the popular conception of the
Evil One.</p>

<p>In all these cases, however, the burlesque was general.
It was of the nature of travestie, and of the vaguest sort.
Of particular parody one finds but few signs in the
Elizabethan drama. There is a little of it in Shakespeare,
where he pokes fun at the turgidity of contemporary tragedy
or at the obscurity of contemporary Euphuism. The
Pyramus and Thisbe episode is less burlesque than satire.
It is an <i lang="fr">exposé</i> of the absurdities of the amateur performer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
for whom Shakespeare, as a professional actor, could have
only an amused contempt.</p>

<p>"The Bard" parodied, but he did not burlesque. That
was left to the initiative of the gifted literary Dioscuri,
Beaumont and Fletcher. "The Knight of the Burning
Pestle," which saw the light in 1611, is not wholly a travestie,
but it contains a travestie within itself. In the main it is
a dramatic exposition of a love story, the scene of which is
laid in the middle-class life of the time. Ralph, the Knight
of the Burning Pestle, is by no means the hero of the tale;
rather is he an excrescence upon it. A grocer and his wife
sit on the stage, and suggest to the actors that Ralph, their
apprentice, shall take part in the performance. They want
a play in which a grocer shall do "admirable things," and
Ralph is bound to do them. The apprentice, it would seem,
is an amateur actor&mdash;he "hath played before," and so finds
no difficulty in adapting himself to the situation. When he
enters, it is "like a grocer in his shop, with two prentices,
reading 'Palmerin of England.'" This gives us the key to
the satire. Ralph is to burlesque the romances of chivalry,
which were then so common in England, as elsewhere.
"Palmerin of England" had been "translated out of French"
by Anthony Munday and assistants, and published between
1580 and 1602. Ralph starts with a quotation from it, and
then goes on to <span class="nwrp">say:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Certainly those knights are much to be commended who, neglecting
their possessions, wander with a squire and a dwarf through the deserts
to relieve poor ladies.... There are no such courteous and fair well-spoken
knights in this age.</p></blockquote>

<p>He whom Palmerin would have called "Fair Sir," and
she whom Rosiclear would have called "Right beauteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Damsel," are now spoken of opprobriously. But why
should not Ralph be the means of wiping out this
<span class="nwrp">reproach?&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why should I not pursue this course, both for the credit of myself
and our company? For amongst all the worthy books of achievements,
I do not call to mind that I yet read of a grocer-errant: I will be the
said knight. Have you heard of any that hath wandered unfurnished
of his squire and dwarf? Thy elder prentice Tim shall be my trusty
squire, and little George my dwarf. Hence, my blue apron! Yet, in
remembrance of my former trade, upon my shield shall be portrayed a
burning pestle, and I will be called the Knight of the Burning Pestle.
My beloved squire, and George my dwarf, I charge you that henceforth
you never call me by any other name but "the right courteous and
valiant Knight of the Burning Pestle"; and that you never call any female
by the name of a woman or wench, but "fair lady," if she have her
desires; if not, "distressed damsel"; that you call all forests and heaths
"deserts," and all horses "palfreys."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this, Ralph reappears at various points in the action.
He interposes, Quixote-like, in the aforesaid love-affair, and
gets belaboured by the favoured lover for his pains. Later,
he puts up at an inn, and, about to leave, is surprised when
the tapster draws his attention to the fact that the reckoning
is not <span class="nwrp">paid:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Ev'ry true knight, and ev'ry damsel fair,<br /></span>

<p><i>Host.</i> Thou valiant Knight of the Burning Pestle, give ear to me:
there is twelve shillings to pay, and as I am a true knight, I will not

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ralph.</i> Sir knight, this mirth of yours becomes you well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, to requite this liberal courtesy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He shall receive from my heroic hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A knighthood, by the virtue of this pestle.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The host, however, insists upon receiving his twelve
shillings, and the grocer's wife, in great fear lest harm
shall befall her Ralph, requests her husband to pay the
money. In a subsequent scene, Ralph conquers the giant
Barbaroso, and releases his captives. By-and-by he goes
into Moldavia, where he touches the heart of the king's
daughter, but tells her that he has already pledged his
troth to Susan, "a cobbler's maid in Malte Street," whom
he vowed never to forsake. At the end of the play he
comes on to explain, at length, that he is dead, taking the
opportunity to recount his various performances.</p>

<p>The fun is never very brilliant; and the "Knight of
the Pestle," albeit by writers so distinguished, is not, for the
present-day Englishman, particularly exhilarating reading.
One can imagine, however, how droll it seemed to our
ancestors, with whom it remained popular for over half a
century, surviving till the time of Mistress Eleanor Gwynne,
who once spoke the prologue to it.</p>

<p>Our first burlesque, then, was a satire upon exaggerated
fiction. Our second was a satire upon extravagant plays.
It is possible that "The Rehearsal" was represented before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
"The Knight of the Burning Pestle" left the boards. Begun
in 1663, and ready for production before 1665, it was first
performed in 1671. It is ascribed to George Villiers, Duke
of Buckingham; but probably there were several hands
engaged in it. It was the outcome of the boredom and
the laughter caused by the wildness and bombast of the
Restoration plays. There were some things in the stage of
that day which the wits could not <span class="nwrp">abide:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here brisk insipid rogues, for wit, let fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes dull sense; but oft'ner none at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, strutting heroes, with a grim-fac'd train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall brave the gods, in King Cambyses' vein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For (changing rules, of late, as if man writ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of reason, nature, art, and wit)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our poets make us laugh at tragedy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with their comedies they make us cry.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So runs the prologue to "The Rehearsal," which was
destined to strike the first blow at the mechanical dramas
that had succeeded the masterpieces of the Shakespearian
period. Bayes, the playwright whose tragedy is supposed to
be "rehearsed," is usually accepted as a skit upon Dryden,
whose dress, speech, and manner were openly mimicked
by Lacy, the interpreter of the part. But there is reason
to believe that Davenant first sat for the portrait, and in the
end Bayes became a sort of incarnated parody of all the
Restoration playwrights. This preposterous play travesties
a whole school of dramatic writing. Dramas by Dryden,
Davenant, James and Henry Howard, Mrs. Behn, and
Sir William Killigrew and others, are directly satirised in
certain passages; but in the main the satire is general.
For instance, in one place fun is made of the prevalence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of similes in the dramas aimed at. Prince Prettyman, in
the rehearsed play, falls asleep, and Chloris, coming in,
finds him in that <span class="nwrp">situation:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Bayes.</i> Now, here she must make a simile.</p>

<p><i>Smith</i> (one of the spectators). Where's the necessity of that, Mr.
Bayes?</p>

<p><i>Bayes.</i> Because she's surpris'd. That's a general rule: you must ever
make a simile when you are surpris'd; 't is the new way of writing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere it is confusion of metaphor, very common
among the second-rate "tragedians," that is derided. Says
the physician in the <span class="nwrp">play:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>All these threat'ning storms, which, like impregnant clouds, do hover
o'er our heads (when once they are grasped but by the eye of reason),
melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people.</p>

<p><i>Bayes.</i> Pray mark that allegory. Is not that good?</p>

<p><i>Johnson</i> (another spectator). Yes, that grasping of a storm with the
eye is admirable.</p></blockquote>

<p>In one place, Smith, the aforesaid onlooker, complains
that, amid all the talk, the plot stands still; to which Bayes
replies, "Why, what the devil is the plot good for but to bring
in fine things?" At another juncture we have the first hint
of a bit of persiflage which Sheridan afterwards imitated in
"The Critic." It has reference to the portentous reticence
of some of the dialogue in Restoration plays. An usher
and a physician are on the <span class="nwrp">stage:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Phys.</i> If Lorenzo should prove false (which none but the great gods
can tell) you then perhaps would find that&mdash;&mdash; <span class="indent1">(<i class="stage-direction">whispers</i>).</span></p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> Alone, do you say?</p>

<p><i>Phys.</i> No, attended with the noble&mdash;&mdash; <span class="indent3">(<i class="stage-direction">whispers</i>).</span></p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> Who, he in grey?</p>

<p><i>Phys.</i> Yes, and at the head of&mdash;&mdash;  <span class="indent5">(<i class="stage-direction">whispers</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> Then, sir, most certain 'twill in time appear,<br />
These are the reasons that have induc'd 'em to't;<br />
First, he&mdash;&mdash; <span class="indent10">(<i class="stage-direction">whispers</i>).</span><br />
Secondly, they&mdash;&mdash; <span class="indent10">(<i class="stage-direction">whispers</i>).</span><br />
Thirdly, and lastly, both he and they&mdash;&mdash; <span class="indent1a">(<i class="stage-direction">whispers</i>).</span></p>

<p><span class="indent10">[<i class="stage-direction">Exeunt whispering.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Well, sir," says Smith to Bayes, "but pray, why all this
whispering?" "Why, sir," replies the dramatist, "because
they are supposed to be politicians, and matters of state
ought not to be divulg'd."</p>

<p>In its direct travestie "The Rehearsal" is often very happy.
Dryden had claimed for his tragedies that they were written
by "th' exactest rules"; so Bayes exhibits to his friends
Smith and Johnson what he calls his "Book of Drama
Commonplaces, the mother of many plays," containing
"certain helps that we men of art have found it convenient
to make use of." "I do here aver," he says, "that no man
yet the sun e'er shone upon has parts sufficient to furnish
out a stage, except it were by the help of these my rules."
Davenant, in his "Love and Honour," had portrayed a
mental and spiritual struggle between those potent forces.
Bayes, accordingly, is made to introduce a scene in which
Prince Volscius, sitting down to pull on his boots, wonders
whether he ought or ought not to perform that <span class="nwrp">operation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My legs, the emblem of my various thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show to what sad distraction I am brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes, with stubborn Honour, like this boot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mind is guarded, and resolv'd to do't:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes, again, that very mind, by Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disarmèd, like this other leg does prove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I to Honour or to Love give way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go on, cries Honour; tender Love says, Nay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour aloud commands, Pluck both boots on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But softer Love does whisper, Put on none.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>In the end, he "goes out hopping, with one boot on,
and t'other off." Again, there was a passage in the drama
called "The Villain," in which the host supplied his guests
with a collation out of his clothes&mdash;a capon from his
helmet, cream out of his scabbard, and so on. In like
manner, Pallas, in Mr. Bayes's tragedy, furnishes forth the
two usurping <span class="nwrp">kings:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, from this conquering lance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does flow the purest wine of France:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to appease your hunger, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have in my helmet brought a pie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly, to bear a part with these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold a buckler made of cheese.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the direct parody in the burlesque a few instances
will suffice. Almanzor, in "The Conquest of Granada,"
becomes the Drawcansir of Mr. Bayes's work; and while
the former <span class="nwrp">ejaculates&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He who dares love, and for that love must die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, knowing this, dares yet love on, am I,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the latter caps it <span class="nwrp">with&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He that dares drink, and for that drink dares die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knowing this, dares yet drink on, am I.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, while Almanzor says to his rival in <span class="nwrp">love&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou dar'st not marry her, while I'm in sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a bent brow, thy priest and thee I'll fright,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Drawcansir, snatching the bowls of wine from the usurpers,
<span class="nwrp">cries&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whoe'er to gulp one drop of this dare think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll stare away his very power to drink.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The simile of the boar and the sow has often been quoted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
it seems to have been always a favourite with our playgoing
ancestors. In "The Conquest of Granada" we <span class="nwrp">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So two kind turtles, when a storm is nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look up, and see it gathering in the sky....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perch'd on some dropping branch, they sit alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coo and hearken to each other's moan.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Bayes imitated this in what he called "one of the most
delicate, dainty similes in the world, <span class="nwrp">egad":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So boar and sow, when any storm is nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snuff up, and smell it gath'ring in the sky....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive in mud they wallow all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snort and gruntle to each other's moan.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The example set by Buckingham in "The Rehearsal" was
followed, more than half a century later, by Henry Fielding,
in "The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom
Thumb the Great." This was brought out in 1730, in two
acts, and was so immediately and largely successful that
the author was induced to expand its two acts into three.
It was afterwards published, with elaborate notes, setting
forth a number of "parallel passages" from Dryden downwards,
and with a preface, in which the supposed editor,
H. Scriblerus Secundus, gravely assigned the origin of the
"tragedy" to the age of Elizabeth. Apropos of parallel
passages, the editor <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whether this sameness of thought and expression [on the part
of the authors quoted] ... proceeded from an agreement in their
way of thinking, or whether they have borrowed from our author,
I leave the reader to determine. I shall adventure to affirm this of
the Sentiments of our author, that they are generally the most familiar
which I have ever met with, and at the same time delivered with the
highest dignity of phrase; which brings me to speak of his diction.
Here I shall only beg one postulatum&mdash;viz., that the greatest perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the language of a tragedy is, that it is not to be understood;
which granted (as I think it must be), it will necessarily follow that
the only ways to avoid this is by being too high or too low for the
understanding, which will comprehend everything within its reach.</p></blockquote>

<p>The editor goes on to say that "our author excelleth"
in both these styles. "He is very rarely within sight
through the whole play, either rising higher than the eye
of your understanding can soar, or sinking lower than it
careth to stoop."</p>

<p>Fielding does not adopt in "Tom Thumb" the machinery
of "The Rehearsal." "Tom Thumb" is a burlesque tragedy,
standing by itself, and intended for representation in the
serious spirit which should animate all true burlesque.
Tom Thumb is "a little hero, with a great soul," who,
as a reward for his victories over the race of giants,
demands in marriage the hand of Huncamunca, the daughter
of King Arthur. As he <span class="nwrp">observes:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I ask not kingdoms, I can conquer those;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ask not money, money I've enough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what I've done, and what I mean to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For giants slain, and giants yet unborn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I will slay&mdash;if this be call'd a debt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take my receipt in full: I ask but this&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sun myself in Huncamunca's eyes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Prodigious bold request," remarks the King; but he
decides, nevertheless, to give Huncamunca to Tom Thumb.
Unhappily, Lord Grizzle is enamoured of the princess, and,
in revenge, leads an insurrection against the Court. He
is, however, conquered by the little hero, who is about to
be wedded to his charmer, when, alas! as he is marching
in triumph through the streets, he is swallowed by "a cow,
of larger than the usual size." Queen Dollallolla, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in love with Tom, slays with her own hand the messenger
who brought the news. Thereupon, Cleora, who is in
love with the messenger, kills the Queen. Huncamunca,
by way of reprisal, kills Cleora. A certain Doodle kills
Huncamunca; one Mustacha kills Doodle; the King kills
Mustacha, and then kills himself, <span class="nwrp">exclaiming&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the child, whom nurse from danger guards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends Jack for mustard with a pack of cards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings, queens and knaves throw one another down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the whole pack lies scatter'd and o'erthrown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So all our pack upon the floor is cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all I boast is&mdash;that I fall the last.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have here a happy satire upon the sanguinary conclusions
given to the tragedies of the seventeenth century.
Great pains, too, are taken, throughout the "tragedy," to
travestie that <i>bête noire</i> of the humourists, the dragged-in
simile, to which not even "The Rehearsal" had given the
<i>coup de grâce</i>. The ghost of Tom Thumb's father is made
to <span class="nwrp">say&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So have I seen the bees in clusters swarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the stars in frosty nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the sand in windy days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the ghost on Pluto's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the flowers in spring arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the leaves in autumn fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the fruits in summer smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have I seen the snow in winter frown.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereupon the king says, "D&mdash;n all thou hast seen!"
Grizzle, when on the point of expiring, <span class="nwrp">cries&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some kinder sprite knocks softly at my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gently whispers it to haste away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I come, I come, most willingly I come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when some city wife, for country air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hampstead or to Highgate does repair,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her to make haste her husband does implore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cries, "My dear, the coach is at the door":<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With equal wish, desirous to be gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gets into the coach, and then she cries, "Drive on!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the mock similes in "Tom Thumb" are among
the most familiar things in literature. We all remember
the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, when two dogs are fighting in the streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a third dog one of the two dogs meets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With angry teeth he bites him to the bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this dog smarts for what that dog has done.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And these&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, when the Cheshire cheese a maggot breeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another and another still succeeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thousands and ten thousands they increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one continued maggot fills the rotten cheese.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The burlesque contained within the pages of "Tom
Thumb" covers a considerable field. Dryden is once
more very freely satirised, some nine or ten of his plays
being held up to ridicule. But much attention is at the
same time paid to dramas which saw the light after the
production of "The Rehearsal." Thus, there are allusions
to the "Mithridates," "Nero," and "Brutus" of Nathaniel
Lee, which belong to 1674-1679; to the "Marius" of
Otway (1680); to the "Anna Bullen," "Earl of Essex,"
"Mary Queen of Scots," and "Cyrus the Great" of Banks
(1680-1696); to the "Persian Princess" of Theobald
(1711), to Addison's "Cato" (1713), to Young's "Busiris"
and "The Revenge," and even to Thomson's "Sophonisba,"
which had come out only in the year preceding that in
which "Tom Thumb" was performed. "O Sophonisba,
Sophonisba O" (which had already been parodied in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
form of "O Jemmy Thomson, Jemmy Thomson O") is
here laughed at in "O Huncamunca, Huncamunca O!"
In "Cyrus the Great" the virtuous Panthea remarks to one
lover&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For two I must confess are gods to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is my Abradatus first, and thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, in a like spirit, Huncamunca, after wedding Tom
Thumb, is quite willing to wed <span class="nwrp">Grizzle:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My ample heart for more than one has room:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid like me Heaven form'd at least for two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I married him, and now I'll marry you,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>thereby reminding us of the obliging defendant in Mr. Gilbert's
"Trial by Jury," who is ready to "marry this lady
to-day, and marry the other to-morrow." In the third act
of "Cato" is a simile which Fielding parodies thus&mdash;putting
it into the mouth of <span class="nwrp">Grizzle:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So have I seen, in some dark winter's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden storm rush down the sky's highway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep through the streets with terrible ding-dong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gush thro' the spouts, and wash whole crowds along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowded shops the thronging vermin screen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together cram the dirty and the clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not one shoe-boy in the street is seen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finally, we have this equally well-known passage, suggested
by the remark of Lee's Mithridates that he "would be
drunk with <span class="nwrp">death":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Doodle.</i> My liege, I a petition have here got.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i> Petition me no petitions, sir, to-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let other hours be set apart for business.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day it is our pleasure to be drunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this our queen shall be as drunk as we.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the fate of "Tom Thumb" to be transformed&mdash;so
far as it was possible to transform it&mdash;into a burlesque of
Italian opera as well as of conventional drama. "Set
to music after the Italian manner," it was brought out in
1733 as "The Opera of Operas," and had considerable
vogue in the new guise thus given to it. It had been
preceded in 1727 by Gay's "Beggar's Opera"; but that
famous work was a social and political satire rather than
a travestie of the exotic lyrical drama. It may be regarded
as a species of prototype of the burletta or ballad opera
of later days. Not even the transformed "Tom Thumb"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
could be called an effective <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> of the
Italian opera of those days. For that the public had to
wait a short time longer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, four years after the production of "Tom
Thumb" came the "Chrononhotonthologos" of Henry
Carey, author of "Sally in our Alley." This also is a
burlesque tragedy, but the travestie is purely general. No
individual play is directly satirised; the satire is aimed
at a whole class of dramas&mdash;the same class as that which
had suggested the composition of "Tom Thumb."</p>

<p>Carey says, in his <span class="nwrp">prologue:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To-night our comic muse the buskin wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives herself no small romantic airs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struts in heroics, and in pompous verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does the minutest incidents rehearse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ridicule's strict retrospect displays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poetasters of these modern days,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who with big bellowing bombast rend our ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, stript of sound, quite void of sense appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else their fiddle-faddle numbers flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serenely dull, elaborately low.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Chrononhotonthologos" is a short piece, in one act and
seven scenes. It is described in its sub-title as "the most
tragical tragedy that ever was tragedised by any company
of tragedians," and it bears out the description tolerably
well. When the curtain rises, there enter two courtiers of
Queerummania&mdash;Rigdum-Funnidos and Aldiborontiphoscophornio.
Says the latter to the <span class="nwrp">former:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aldiborontiphoscophornio!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chrononhotonthologos is the king, and we learn that he
is in his tent, in a kind of waking slumber. Presently he
enters, very much put out that he should be so inclined to
doze, and very angry, consequently, with the God of Sleep.
Says <span class="nwrp">he:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sport not with Chrononhotonthologos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou idle slumb'rer, thou detested Somnus;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and "exits in a huff." Whereupon the two courtiers, who
have retired, <span class="nwrp">re-enter:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Rigdum.</i> The King is in a most cursed passion! Pray who is the
Mr. Somnus he's so angry withal?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Aldi.</i> The son of Chaos and of Erebus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incestuous pair! brother of Mors relentless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose speckled robe, and wings of blackest hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astonish all mankind with hideous glare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, with sable plumes, to men benevolent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings downy slumbers and refreshing sleep.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Rigdum.</i> This gentleman may come of a very good family, for aught I
know; but I would not be in his place for the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Aldi.</i> But lo! the king his footsteps this way bending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cogitative faculties immers'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cogibundity of cogitation.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Thereupon the king re-enters, followed almost immediately
by the captain of the guard, who informs him that
"th' antipodean pow'rs from realms below have burst the
entrails of the earth" and threaten the safety of the
kingdom. "This world is too incopious to contain them;
armies on armies march in form stupendous"&mdash;"tier on
tier, high pil'd from earth to heaven." The king, however,
is not alarmed. He bids Bombardinian, his general, draw
his legions forth, and orders the priests to prepare their
temples for rites of <span class="nwrp">triumph:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Let the singing singers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vocal voices, most vociferous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sweet vociferation, out-vociferise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n sound itself.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Happily the Antipodeans (who walk upon their hands) are
badly beaten, and all run away except their king, with
whom, alas! Fadladinida, the wife of Chrononhotonthologos,
promptly falls in love. As she herself says to her favourite
<span class="nwrp">maiden:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, my Tatlanthe! Have you seen his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His air, his shape, his mien, his ev'ry grace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In what a charming attitude he stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How prettily he foots it with his hands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, to his arms&mdash;no, to his legs&mdash;I fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I must have him, if I live or die.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Bombardinian has invited the King to drink
wine with him in his tent. The King accepts, but, not
content with liquor, asks for something more <span class="nwrp">substantial:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hold, Bombardinian, I esteem it fit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With so much wine, to eat a little bit.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>The cook suggests "some nice cold pork in the pantry,"
and is instantly slain by the irate monarch, who, deeming
that Bombardinian is "braving" him, strikes him. Whereupon
the <span class="nwrp">General:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The doctor, pronouncing the king dead, is killed by the
General, who then kills himself. The Queen mourns her
widowhood, and Tatlanthe proposes that she should wed
Rigdum-Funnidos. To this, however, Aldiborontiphoscophornio
objects; and so, to save discussion, the Queen will
give no preference to <span class="nwrp">either:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Produced in 1734, "Chrononhotonthologos" was performed
at intervals until 1815, when it was seen at Drury
Lane, with Oxberry in the title-part and Dowton as the
General. After that it remained out of the theatrical
repertory until 1880, when Mr. John Hollingshead revived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
it, for one representation, at the Gaiety.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is a slight
piece of work, but contains some elements of comicality.
It will always be esteemed by literary students, if only
because the names of Rigdum-Funnidos and Aldiborontiphoscophornio
struck the fancy of Sir Walter Scott, who
bestowed them, in fun, upon the brothers Constable,
the publishers. "Aldiborontiphoscophornio" is surely the
perfection of mock-tragedy nomenclature.</p>

<p>It is to Carey that we owe, not only "Chrononhotonthologos,"
but the first really effective burlesque of Italian opera.
In 1737 there was brought out at the Haymarket "The
Dragon of Wantley," a "burlesque opera," of which Carey
had written the dialogue and songs, and for which John
Frederick Lampe had composed the music. Its object,
according to the author, was "to display in English the
beauty of nonsense, so prevailing in the Italian operas." The
story was founded on the old ballad, with which, however,
liberties were taken. In the first act, the natives of "that
part of Yorkshire near Rotherham" are shown in much
excitement, due to the ravages of the dragon, which has
just entered the Squire's residence and consumed all the
coffee, toast, and butter that was set out for breakfast.
Says one <span class="nwrp">Gubbins:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This Dragon very modish, sure, and nice is:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall we do in this disastrous crisis?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which his daughter Margery <span class="nwrp">replies:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thought, to quell him, comes into my Head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Way more proper, than to kill him dead.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far hence lives "a valiant knight," named Moore, of
Moore Hall, who may be trusted to destroy the dragon.
Moore accordingly is approached, surrenders to the charms
of Margery, and undertakes to do the deed. Meanwhile,
Mauxalinda, an old flame of Moore's, becomes jealous of
Margery, and seeks to slay her with a bodkin&mdash;a fate from
which Moore happily rescues her. Mauxalinda is then
threatened with quarter sessions; but she <span class="nwrp">cries&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O give me not up to the Law,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Once in a Sollicitor's Paw,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You never get out of his Clutches.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Moore thereupon prepares to start for the Dragon's den:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But first I'll drink, to make me strong and mighty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six quarts of ale, and one of Aqua Vitæ.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Duly encountering the monster, Moore kills him (say the
stage directions) with a kick in the rear, the Dragon crying
"Oh, oh, oh! the Devil take your toe!" After that,
Gubbins <span class="nwrp">declares:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And rend the Welkin with harmonious Din.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thereupon there is this general <span class="nwrp">chorus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>"The music," says the chronicler, "was made as grand
and pompous as possible, to heighten the contrast between
that and the words"&mdash;thus anticipating the comic method
which has been utilised with so much success by Mr.
Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan.</p>

<p>From "The Dragon of Wantley," which, as might be
expected, had a very considerable vogue, we come to "The
Critic, or a Tragedy Rehearsed"&mdash;the last, and not the
least, of Sheridan's dramatic works, produced in Drury Lane
in 1779. Of so familiar a piece, what is there to be said?
Is it not played with tolerable frequency at "benefits," for
the sake of the "exceptional casts" it can supply? Have
not all middle-aged playgoers seen and admired the younger
Mathews as Sir Fretful Plagiary and Mr. Puff? Assuredly
there are certain features of "The Critic" which everybody
remembers. Everybody remembers Sir Fretful's famous
lines on the plagiarists, who "serve your best thoughts
as gypsies do stolen children&mdash;disfigure them to make 'em
pass for their own"; as well as his special addendum about
the "dexterous" writer who "might take out some of the
best things in my tragedy and put them into his own
comedy." Everybody remembers, too, Mr. Puffs no less
famous catalogue of the varieties of <i>réclame</i>; his remark
that "the number of those who undergo the fatigue of
judging for themselves is very small indeed"; his explanation
of the fact that he and Shakespeare had made use
of the same thought; Lord Burleigh's shake of the head,
which meant so much, and has become proverbial; the
Spanish fleet, which could not be seen because it was
not yet in sight; Tilburina, "mad in white satin"&mdash;and the
like. It must be recollected, however, that "The Critic"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
as played and "The Critic" as written and printed are two
very different things. In the acting version, the earlier
scenes between Puff and Dangle and Sneer, as well as the
latter portion of the "tragedy rehearsed," are very much
compressed&mdash;no doubt with advantage to the public, for,
clever as "The Critic" is as a whole, certain portions of it
are out of date, and would not "go" well with a modern
audience.</p>

<p>In glancing through the printed version, one is struck
anew by the similarity that "The Critic" bears to "The
Rehearsal," not only in form, but in detail. In both cases
a dramatic author rehearses a tragedy in the presence of
a couple of friends, who interject comments upon the performance.
But the likeness does not end here&mdash;possibly
because the theatrical world of 1779 was, in all essentials,
very like the theatrical world of 1671. Bayes, in "The
Rehearsal," says that he has "appointed two or three dozen"
of his friends "to be ready in the pit" (at the <i>première</i> of
his piece), "who, I'm sure, will clap." And so Sneer, in
"The Critic," expects that he will not be able to get into
Drury Lane on the first night of Puff's play, "for on the
first night of a piece they always fill the house with orders
to support it." Again, Bayes says that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let a man write never so well, there are, nowadays, a sort of persons
they call critics, that, egad, have no more wit in them than so many
hobby-horses; but they'll laugh at you, sir, and find fault, and censure
things that, egad, I'm sure they are not able to do themselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a similar spirit Sir Fretful stigmatises the newspapers as
"the most villainous&mdash;licentious&mdash;abominable&mdash;infernal&mdash;&mdash; Not
that I ever read them&mdash;no. I make it a rule never to
look into a newspaper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In one respect Sheridan's work is quite unlike the Duke
of Buckingham's. It contains no direct travestie or parody
of any kind. The burlesque is "at large" throughout.
The satire embodied in the dialogue between Puff and
his friends reflects upon all old-fashioned playwriting of
the "tragic" sort. Puff opens the second scene of his
"Spanish Armada" with a clock striking four, which,
besides recording the time, not only "begets an awful
attention in the audience," but "saves a description of
the rising sun, and a great deal about gilding the
eastern hemisphere." He makes his characters tell one
another what they know already, because, although they
know it, the audience do not. He hears the stage
cannon go off three times instead of once, and complains,
"Give these fellows a good thing, and they never know
when to have done with it." "Where they do agree on
the stage," he says, in another hackneyed passage, "their
unanimity is wonderful." In the rehearsed tragedy itself
the travestie is general, not particular. Here Sheridan
satirises a different class of tragedy from that which
Buckingham dealt with. As the prologue (not by Sheridan,
however) <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In those gay days of wickedness and wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Villiers criticised what Dryden writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tragic queen, to please a tasteless crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had learn'd to bellow, rant, and roar so loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That frighten'd Nature, her best friend before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blustering beldam's company forswore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The later "tragedy" took another <span class="nwrp">tone:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The frantic hero's wild delirium past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now insipidity succeeds bombast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So slow Melpomene's cold numbers creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here dulness seems her drowsy court to keep.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>Dulness, then, is what Sheridan is chiefly girding at, but
he has a keen eye also for the unconscious banalities of
the <i>genre</i> he is dealing with. How truly comic, for instance,
is the prayer to Mars offered up by Leicester and his
companions!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behold thy votaries submissive beg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt deign to grant them all they ask;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assist them to accomplish all their ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sanctify whatever means they use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain them.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How delicious, too, in their absolute nonsense, are the
lines given to the distraught Tilburina!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind whistles&mdash;the moon rises&mdash;see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have killed my squirrel in his cage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this a grasshopper?&mdash;Ha! no; it is my<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiskerandos&mdash;you shall not keep him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know you have him in your pocket&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An oyster may be cross'd in love!&mdash;who says<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A whale's a bird?&mdash;Ha! did you call, my love?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's here! he's there!&mdash;He's everywhere!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! he's nowhere!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For the rest, the text of the tragedy, as printed, is very
dissimilar from the text as played. In representation, most
of the fun is got out of intentional perversion of certain
words or phrases. Thus, "martial symmetry" becomes
"martial cemetery";</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The famed Armada, by the Pope baptised,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>becomes</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The famed Armada, by the Pope capsised;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"friendship's closing line" is turned into "friendship's
clothes-line"; "My gentle Nora" into "My gentle Snorer";
"Cupid's baby woes" into "Cupid's baby clothes";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"matchless excellence" into "matchless impudence," and
so on. This is sorry stuff; and those who desire to
appreciate Sheridan's travestie of the tragedy of his day
must read "The Critic" in its published shape.</p>

<p>The next notable attempt at the burlesque of conventional
tragedy was a return to the methods of "Chrononhotonthologos."
In "Bombastes Furioso" (first played in 1816<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>)
all satirical machinery was discarded; all that the author&mdash;William
Barnes Rhodes&mdash;sought to do was to travestie his
originals in a brief and telling story. "Bombastes" is not
now so often performed as it used to be; but not so very
long ago it was turned into a comic opera, under the title
of "Artaxominous the Great," and its humours are fairly well
known to the public. Some of these the world will not
willingly let die. One still thinks with amusement of the
"army" of Bombastes, consisting of "one Drummer, one
Fifer, and two Soldiers, all very materially differing in size";
of the General's exhortation to his troops&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Begone, brave army, and don't kick up a row;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and of the boastful challenge of the General, so promptly
accepted by Artaxominous&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who dares this pair of boots displace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must meet Bombastes face to face.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the piece bears re-perusal wonderfully well. Its
literary merit is assuredly not less than that of "Chrononhotonthologos":
it is perhaps even greater. The opening
colloquy between the King and Fusbos is genuinely diverting,
embodying as it does one of those mock similes so dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to the satirists of old-fashioned tragedy. The King admits
to Fusbos that he is "but middling&mdash;that is, <em>so so</em>!" It is
not, however, either the mulligrubs or the blue-devils that
disturb <span class="nwrp">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i> Last night, when undisturb'd by state affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moist'ning our clay, and puffing off our cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft the replenish'd goblet did we drain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank and smok'd, and smok'd and drank again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the case, our very actions such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at length we got a drop too much.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fusbos.</i> So when some donkey on the Blackheath road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls, overpower'd, beneath his sandy load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The driver's curse unheeded swells the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since none can carry more than they can bear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By-and-by the King confides to Fusbos that his heart is not
wholly faithful to Queen Griskinissa&mdash;that he is also hopelessly
in love with Distaffina, the acknowledged sweetheart
of Bombastes. Under the circumstances he asks for
Fusbos' <span class="nwrp">advice:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall I my Griskinissa's charms forego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compel her to give up the regal chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And place the rosy Distaffina there?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a case, what course can I pursue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love my queen, and Distaffina too.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fusbos.</i> And would a king his general supplant?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't advise, upon my soul I can't.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i> So when two feasts, whereat there's nought to pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall unpropitious on the self-same day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The anxious Cit each invitation views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ponders which to take and which refuse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this or that to keep away is loth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighs to think he cannot dine at both.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These, however, are not the best known of the mock
similes in "Bombastes." For those we have to look to the
scene in which the King, observing his General's above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>mentioned
challenge, reviles Bombastes and knocks down
his boots. Then we have the familiar <span class="nwrp">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bomb.</i> So have I heard on Afric's burning shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hungry lion give a grievous roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grievous roar echo'd along the shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i> So have I heard on Afric's burning shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another lion give a grievous roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first lion thought the last a bore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next comes the fight between the monarch and the
warrior; the King is killed, and then Fusbos kills Bombastes.
Finally, the two deceased (despite the assertion of Fusbos
that they are "dead as herrings&mdash;herrings that are red")
come to life again, and all ends happily.</p>

<p>Of ordinary parody there is little in the piece, and what
there is can scarcely be said to be of the best. There is a
suggestion, in one ditty, of "Hope told a flattering Tale."
But better than this is the song suggested by "My Lodging
is on the Cold Ground," which is happy both intrinsically
and as an imitation. Fusbos is the <span class="nwrp">singer:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My lodging is in Leather Lane,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>At this point, English stage burlesque suddenly takes
a new departure, combining, with satire of the contemporary
native "boards," satire not less keen of certain products of
the foreign muse. The incident came about in this way:&mdash;Just
before the close of the eighteenth century, the English
book-market had been flooded with translations of certain
German plays, including Schiller's "Robbers" and "Cabal
and Love," Goethe's "Stella," and Kotzebue's "Misanthropy
and Repentance" ("The Stranger") and "Count Benyowsky."
Canning, Ellis, and Frere, who were then bringing out
<em>The Anti-Jacobin</em>, were struck by the absurdities contained
within these dramas, and accordingly composed and printed
(in June 1798) that well-known skit, "The Rovers, or the
Double Arrangement." In this the plays chiefly parodied
are "Stella," "The Stranger," and "Count Benyowsky." By
"Stella" was suggested not only "the double arrangement"
(by which Matilda and Cecilia share the affections of their
lover Casimere), but the famous scene in which the two
women, before they know they are rivals, become, on the
instant, bosom friends. Both admit that they are in love,
and then&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Cecilia.</i> Your countenance grows animated, my dear madam.</p>

<p><i>Matilda.</i> And yours is glowing with illumination.</p>

<p><i>Cecilia.</i> I had long been looking out for a congenial spirit! My
heart was withered, but the beams of yours have rekindled it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Matilda.</i> A sudden thought strikes me: let us swear an eternal
friendship.</p>

<p><i>Cecilia.</i> Let us agree to live together!</p>

<p><i>Matilda.</i> Willingly.</p>

<p><i>Cecilia.</i> Let us embrace.<span class="i6">(<i class="stage-direction">They embrace.</i>)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The Rovers," however, would hardly come within the
scope of the present volume, were it not that, in 1811, at
the Haymarket, there was produced, by Colman junior, a
piece called "The Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh, or the
Rovers of Weimar," in which the adapter made use of
the squib in <em>The Anti-Jacobin</em>. Colman's aim in this work
was to ridicule not only the German plays, including
Kotzebue's "Spaniards in Peru" ("Pizarro"), which had
lately been brought before the English playgoer, but also
the prevailing fancy for bringing animals upon the stage.
At Astley's horses had figured both in "Blue Beard" and
in "Timour the Tartar," and dogs had previously been seen
in "The Caravan." To this, as well as to the unhealthy
importations from Germany, allusion was made in the
<span class="nwrp">prologue:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To lull the soul by spurious strokes of art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To warp the genius and mislead the heart,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>(a hit at "The Stranger"),</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>"The Quadrupeds of Quedlinburgh" was not printed, and
one does not know to what extent Colman took advantage
of the text of "The Rovers." It is certain, however, that
Casimere, Matilda, and Cecilia, as well as Rogero (a creation
of the original parodists), all appeared in the burlesque,
being enacted respectively by Munden, Mrs. Glover,
Mrs. Gibbs, and Liston, Elliston taking the <i>rôle</i> of
Bartholomew Bathos, a lineal descendant (no doubt) of
Bayes and Puff. We read that, in addition to the travestie
supplied by <em>The Anti-Jacobin</em>, fun was poked at the sentimental
sentinel in "Pizarro," and the last scene of "Timour
the Tartar" was closely imitated. The piece was acted
thirty-nine times, and must therefore have been what,
in those days, was accounted a success.</p>

<p>We come now to a travestie of the old-fashioned
tragedy which helps to connect the Old burlesque
with the New, inasmuch as it was the production
of James Robinson Planché. Of his "Amoroso, King
of Little Britain: a serio-comick bombastick operatick
interlude," played at Drury Lane in 1818, Planché was
not particularly proud. He was very young when he wrote
it; he wrote it for amateur performance; and it got on
to the stage of Drury Lane without his knowledge and
consent. Harley, the comedian, appears to have seen or
read the little trifle, and to have recommended it to the
manager of "the national theatre." He himself represented
Amoroso; Knight was Roastando (a cook); Smith
was Blusterbus (a yeoman of the guard); Mrs. Bland
was Coquetinda (the Queen of Little Britain), and Mrs.
Orger was Mollidusta (a chambermaid). The piece was
much applauded, and had the distinction of being quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in the <cite>Times</cite>. It opens with the King being awakened by
his courtiers, to whom he angrily <span class="nwrp">exclaims:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Leave at what time you please your truckle beds&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I swear I'm quite disordered with this rout.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ahem! My lords and gentlemen&mdash;get out!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <cite>Times</cite> applied the last line to a Parliamentary
incident which had just occurred; and Planché admits
that he was flattered by the compliment. But he would
not include "Amoroso" in the testimonial edition of his
burlesques and extravaganzas,&mdash;mainly, I imagine, because
the piece is so obviously an imitation of "Bombastes
Furioso," which it by no means equals in literary distinction.</p>

<p>The plot is simplicity itself. Amoroso is in love with
Mollidusta, Mollidusta with Blusterbus, and the Queen
with Roastando. "The King sees Roastando and the
Queen salute: he discharges Roastando. The Queen sees
the King and Mollidusta together: she stabs Mollidusta.
The King stabs the Queen, Roastando stabs the King, the
King stabs Roastando." In the end, all come to life again.
In the course of the play the King thus declares his passion
to <span class="nwrp">Mollidusta:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>Amoroso also sings the following pseudo-sentimental

<p>Three months after "Amoroso" had been seen at Drury
Lane, there was produced at the English Opera House
a "serio-comic-bombastic-operatic interlude," written by
George Daniel, and called "Doctor Bolus"&mdash;yet another
burlesque of the old-fashioned drama, owing quite as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to "Bombastes Furioso" as did "Amoroso." In this piece
the King, Artipadiades (Harley), is in love with Poggylina,
a maid of honour, while the Queen, Katalinda (Miss Kelly),
is enamoured of General Scaramoucho (Chatterley). The
General revolts, and is defeated by the King. His amour
is discovered, and, while the Queen is poisoned with one
of Bolus's "infallible" pills, the General is stabbed by
Artipadiades. The Queen, however, revives, and is
thereupon stabbed by the King, who also stabs himself.
But, in the end, as in "Amoroso," all the dead people
are resuscitated. There are some gleams of humour in
the dialogue, but not many. Bolus was played by John
Wilkinson.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE "PALMY" DAYS.</p>


<p>After the production of "Amoroso," Planché remained
silent, so far as travestie was concerned, till 1831,
when he began in earnest his successful career as a burlesque
writer. In the interval a new votary of travestie
appeared in the person of Fox Cooper, of whose "Elbow
Shakers" and "Ion" I shall have something to say by-and-by.
Moncrieff and Buckstone, too, followed the example
of T. Dibdin, in dealing more or less humorously with
the subject of "Don Giovanni," while Buckstone also
essayed to do the same with that of "Billy Taylor." None
of these effusions, however, were burlesques in the ordinary
acceptation of the word; and 1831, therefore, may still
be taken as the starting-point of the new theatrical era,
of which Planché was the herald.</p>

<p>This era may be said to divide naturally into fairly
balanced parts, the first extending from 1831 to 1865,
the period covered by Planché's activity in the work; the
second from 1865 to 1885, by which time Mr. Edward
Terry and Miss Kate Vaughan had retired from the Gaiety.
Within the former moiety are comprised the labours of four
men who for many years shared with Planché the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of stage travestie. Need I say that I mean Gilbert Abbott
a'Beckett (with whom Mark Lemon so frequently collaborated),
Francis Talfourd, and the Brothers Brough?
Planché's "Olympic Revels" (1831) was followed by
A'Beckett's "Son of the Sun" in 1834, by Talfourd's
"Macbeth" in 1847, and by the Brothers Brough's
"Enchanted Isle" in 1848. The "Joan of Arc" of
William Brough was seen in 1869; its writer had been
producing burlesque for over twenty years. Talfourd's
career as a dramatist was comparatively brief. Beginning
in 1847, it ended in 1860, but was brilliant while it lasted.</p>

<p>Modern burlesque was fortunate indeed in its founders&mdash;all
of them men of education and refinement, all of them
men of letters as well as playwrights. To the literary merit
of their products it is unnecessary to bear more than the
briefest testimony, for it is everywhere, and by everybody,
acknowledged. In the writings of these four men theatrical
burlesque was seen at its best. They came fresh to the
task, and made the most of their opportunities. They set
themselves really to travestie and to parody, and were
careful to present, amid their wildest comicalities, a
definite, intelligible story. They dropped naturally into
the decasyllabic couplet, and made free use of the pun;
but in neither case did they become mechanical or strained.
The verse of Planché and A'Beckett is smoothness itself, and
they do not descend to word-torturing. Talfourd and the
Broughs took more licence in this latter respect, but they
never sank into drivel. Above all, not one of these five
masters of burlesque permitted themselves to be vulgar
either in general treatment or in verbal detail. They were
nice in their choice of subjects, and, like Mr. W. S. Gilbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in the case of "The Princess," perverted them respectfully.
One finds no horseplay in the fun of these genuine
humourists. All their effects are made legitimately, and in
decent fashion.</p>

<p>They were happy, too, in the good influence they exercised.
The list of their colleagues during the period named is notable.
One meets early with the names of Charles Selby and W. H.
Oxberry. Then come those of Albert Smith, Kenny, and
Shirley Brooks, Leicester Buckingham, and Andrew Halliday,
by whom much excellent work was achieved in the 'forties
and 'fifties. Of lesser note, in this particular department of
endeavour, were Leman Rede, Stirling Coyne, and Tom
Taylor, who were more distinguished in other fields. Selby
and Oxberry had the knack of writing for the stage which
so often results from experience in acting. Smith, Brooks,
Buckingham, Halliday, Rede, Coyne, and Taylor, were
men whose literary skill, acquired in other quarters, was of
eminent service to the comic stage. Especially is it to be
regretted that the genial and witty author of "Sooner or
Later" did not devote more of his time and talent to the
service of burlesque, of the qualities and possibilities of
which he had so keen a sense.</p>

<p>But to turn now to the second moiety of the period
above named&mdash;that extending from 1865 to 1885. We
find that this, too, has had the good fortune to be dominated
by some burlesque writers of very special capacity&mdash;to
wit, Mr. F. C. Burnand, the late H. J. Byron, Mr. W. S.
Gilbert, and Mr. Robert Reece. Mr. Burnand has been
bringing out burlesques ever since 1855, when he wrote
"Villikins and his Dinah" for the Cambridge A.D.C.
His first London production was his "Dido," seen at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
St. James's in 1860. His metropolitan career, therefore, has
covered more than thirty years. Byron began at the Strand
in 1858, and ended at the Gaiety in 1879. Mr. Gilbert's
labours as a producer of travestie in the ordinary sense
started early in the 'sixties with "Dr. Dulcamara," and
closed in 1870 with "The Princess."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Reece opened
in 1865 with "Prometheus"; and work in which he had a
part was witnessed so recently as 1886.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert soon found that his true <i>métier</i> lay outside
the bounds of ordinary burlesque, and his "Princess" was
the stepping-stone to "The Palace of Truth," and, in due
course, to "H.M.S. <i>Pinafore</i>" and its successors. His
travesties of "L'Elisir d'Amore," "La Fille du Régiment,"
"The Bohemian Girl," "Norma," and "Robert le Diable,"
had, however, what all the best specimens of English
stage burlesque have had&mdash;a literary quality and an entire
absence of coarseness or suggestiveness; and no doubt they
had, at the time, their due effect upon the public taste.
Meanwhile, the premier burlesque writers of the past thirty
years are Mr. Burnand, Byron, and Mr. Reece, whose
productions have been as notable for their multiplicity and
variety as for their technical excellence. All three, like the
ablest of their predecessors, have written extravaganza as
well as travestie; and, in travestie, they have gone far afield,
essaying and succeeding in all subjects and all styles. They,
too, have favoured, in the main, the decasyllabic couplet and
the pun, bringing both of them to all the comic perfection
of which they were capable. The pun, in particular, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
reached its highest phase in the writings of these consummate
jugglers with words.</p>

<p>Mr. H. B. Farnie had a considerable vogue in burlesque
from 1870 to 1885, but never displayed the neatness or the
spontaneity of the writers above mentioned. He was fluent,
but that was all. Mr. Alfred Thompson at one time did
good things in this direction, and so did Mr. Conway
Edwardes. Mr. G. A. Sala composed one burlesque, but
has not been induced to give it a successor. Mr. Herman
Merivale has been content to write two: that he has not
written more is to be regretted. Among other recent writers
of travestie may be named&mdash;Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett,
Mr. Harry Paulton, Mr. F. W. Green, Mr. Arthur Matthison,
Mr. Savile Clarke, Mr. W. Younge, Mr. Edward Rose, Mr.
Alfred Murray, Mr. Albert Chevalier, Mr. George Dance,
Mr. G. P. Hawtrey, Mr. Horace Lennard, Mr. Geoffrey
Thorn, and Mr. Cecil Raleigh. In the provinces great
successes have been made by Mr. J. McArdle and Mr.
Wilton Jones. Of Messrs. Sims and Pettitt, Stephens and
Yardley, "Richard Henry," and "A. C. Torr" and H. Mills,
I shall have something to say when I come to consider
"The New Burlesque," of which they have been the
principal producers. If, within the last twenty years or so,
travestie has been confined to a smaller number of theatres
than before, and if it has been proportionately "depressed,"
that has been owing, chiefly, to the popularity of comic
opera and farcical comedy, into the composition and exposition
of which has been thrown, of necessity, very much of
the talent which otherwise would have been devoted to the
writing and acting of burlesque.</p>

<p>On the whole, the days between 1831 and 1885 were, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
burlesque, "palmy" days indeed. They produced not only
many admirable writers of the <i>genre</i>, but many admirable
actors thereof. Planché was generous in his praise of the
artists who helped so greatly to make his pieces "go"; and
he did well to be so, for never, I suppose, was a comic
writer so fortunate in his interpreters. During his first
years at the Olympic he had the aid of the incomparable
Vestris, of Rebecca Isaacs, of Miss Murray, of Mrs.
Macnamara, of Mrs. Honey, of John Brougham, of James
Bland, of James Vining, and of Charles James Mathews,&mdash;all
in the first rank of their art. At Covent Garden, from
1840 to 1843, the company included, at different times, not
only Mme. Vestris, Mrs. Macnamara, Brougham, Bland,
and Vining, but Harley, Wm. Harrison, Morris Barnett,
Selby, Miss Fairbrother, Miss Priscilla Horton, Mrs. C.
Jones, and Mrs. Alfred Wigan. At the Haymarket, during
the three years following, Planché had his ideas carried
out, not only by Bland and Miss Horton, and during one
year by Mme. Vestris and Charles Mathews, but also
by Caulfield, Widdicomb, Tilbury, Brindal, Braid, Julia
Bennett, Miss Reynolds, and Mrs. L. S. Buckingham.
Continuously lucky in this respect, Planché enjoyed&mdash;from
1847 to 1853, at the Lyceum&mdash;the services of Miss Fitzwilliam,
Julia St. George, Miss Oliver, John Reeve, Robert
Roxby, Basil Baker, and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Matthews, in
addition to Vestris and Mathews and many others of the
artists named above. Finally, and best, when Planché
brought out, at the Olympic, his "Yellow Dwarf," his
"Discreet Princess," and his "Young and Handsome," his
chief comedian was the "great little Robson," the fame of
whose tragi-comic outbursts still lingers among us, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
had for his successive supporters Horace Wigan, Emery,
James Rogers, Julia St. George, Miss Maskell (Mrs. Walter
Baynham), and Miss Swanborough.</p>

<p>What, meanwhile, had been the <em>personnel</em> at the other
houses of burlesque? At the Strand in the 'thirties, the
great favourites were W. J. Hammond, H. Hall, Mitchell,
Oxberry, G. Cooke, Miss Daly, Miss Horton. At the Fitzroy
one finds Miss Chaplin and W. Rogers; at the Victoria,
Rogers and Mitchell; at the St. James's, Hall and Mme. Sala;
at Sadler's Wells, Rogers and C. H. Pitt; at the Queen's,
T. F. Matthews and Mrs. Selby; and at the Adelphi, O
Smith, John Reeve, and Mrs. Stirling. Early in the 'forties
we see Wright and Paul Bedford moving from the Princess's
to the Adelphi, where Miss Chaplin and Miss Woolgar are
also located. At the Strand we find Wigan, Hammond,
and R. Romer. Later, we come across Keeley in burlesque
at the Haymarket, along with Bland, Miss Reynolds, and
Miss Horton. The second half of the century opens
brilliantly at the Strand, where Reeve, Rogers, Romer, and
Maskell are the male comedians, with Miss Marshall, Miss
Romer, Miss Maskell, and Mrs. Horsman as their helpmates.
Was not that a truly strong company? And was not the
Adelphi fortunate, about the same time, in the possession
of Miss Woolgar, Miss Mary Keeley, Keeley himself, and
Paul Bedford? At the Haymarket were Buckstone and
Mrs. Caulfield. Some of these may be names only to the
uninstructed reader; but to the theatrical student they all
convey a world of meaning, conjuring up a multitude of
delightful associations.</p>

<p>When we come to 1856 we reach a landmark in the
history of burlesque acting. William Brough's "Perdita" is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
"put up" by Charles Dillon at the Lyceum, and in the
cast of it we find not only Miss Woolgar and the author,
but that very youthful actress Marie Wilton, and that rising
young comedian J. L. Toole. Here, then, is the beginning
of the modern <i>régime</i>. Robson and Julia St. George are
still playing at the Olympic; but the "palmy" days of the
Strand Theatre are about to flash upon us. Marie Wilton
stays for another year at the Lyceum, but in 1858 she is
comfortably lodged at the little playhouse across the way,
together with Bland and Poynter and Mrs. Selby, and
Johnny Clarke, H. J. Turner, and Miss Ternan. In 1859
Charlotte Saunders is playing a mock Romeo to Marie
Wilton's mock Juliet, and Eleanor Bufton and Maria
Simpson and "Jimmy" Rogers are also members of the troupe&mdash;the
one troupe which can regard itself as the legitimate
successor to the Vestris-Mathews "combinations." In the
year following, a new star arises at the Lyceum in the
person of Lydia Thompson; at the St. James's are Nelly
Moore and Cecilia Ranoe and Charles Young; at the
Haymarket are Chippendale, Compton, and C. Coghlan.
A few months more, and the name of Kate Terry appears
on the burlesque bill at the St. James's. Fanny Josephs and
E. Danvers have been added to the Strand establishment,
which shortly welcomes Fanny Hughes and Ada Swanborough,
Polly Marshall and George Honey.</p>

<p>Next comes the turn of the little Royalty. We are in
1863, and Mr. Burnand's "Ixion" is announced, with
Jenny Wilmore in the title-part, David James as Mercury,
Felix Rogers as Minerva, Mrs. Charles Selby as the Queen,
and Ada Cavendish as Venus. Here, again, is a landmark,
not to be left unnoted; here we have to record the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
many triumphs to come. Next year both David James
and Thomas Thorne are in the troupe at the Strand, where
they are destined to remain till they open the Vaudeville
in 1870. In the year next again, the burlesque company at
the Olympic is seen to include a young actress of the name
of Ellen Farren, one day to become the chief tender of the
"sacred lamp"; along with her are Amy Sheridan, Louisa
Moore, Patti Josephs, and Mrs. Stephens. Meanwhile, the
Royalty has been running neck and neck with the Strand,
and growing greatly in public favour. By 1866 it is ripe
for another success&mdash;the most remarkable ever achieved
on the burlesque boards&mdash;secured by the "Black-eyed
Susan" of Mr. Burnand, with Fred Dewar as Captain Crosstree,
Mr. Charles Wyndham as a Deal smuggler, Miss
Oliver as Susan, Miss Nellie Bromley as Dolly Mayflower,
and E. Danvers as Dame Hatley. After this one notes the
addition to the Strand troupe, first, of Miss Eliza Johnstone,
Miss Elise Holt, and Miss Weathersby; and next, of Miss
Lydia Thompson. At the New Queen's in 1868, Miss
Kate Santley and Miss Henrietta Hodson are playing
burlesque with W. H. Stephens and "Lal" Brough. In
the same year the Gaiety Theatre is opened, by Mr.
John Hollingshead with a new burlesque by Mr. W. S.
Gilbert&mdash;"Robert the Devil," in which the leading character
is undertaken by Miss Ellen Farren.</p>

<p>From this date onwards it is not necessary to do more
than indicate a few salient points in connection with
burlesque acting in this country. The opening of the
Gaiety was the first step towards the expansion of the
Old burlesque into the New. In the following year Mr.
Edward Terry entered on an engagement at the Strand&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
engagement which lasted till 1877, and did as much
for the progress of stage travestie as did that of Miss
Farren at the other house. In 1869 there was burlesque
at the Globe, with Edward Marshall and Miss Maggie
Brennan, and at the St. James's with Mrs. John Wood in
"La Belle Sauvage."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In 1870 Harry Paulton went to
the Strand; and at the Royalty were Rachel Sanger, Arthur
Wood, and Alfred Bishop. In 1871 there was burlesque
at the Court, with Mlle. D'Anka, Miss Oliver, Miss Kate
Bishop and Mr. Righton. At the Vaudeville, next year,
Miss Nelly Power and Miss Marie Rhodes were supporting
Messrs. James and Thorne; while at the Royalty were
Miss Emma Chambers, Miss Kate Phillips, and Miss
Harriett Coveney.</p>

<p>In 1873 Mr. E. W. Royce goes to the Gaiety, and Miss
Lottie Venne is seen at the Court in "The Happy Land."
At the Folly, next year, Mr. Edouin takes the fancy of
the town as the Heathen Chinee in Mr. Farnie's "Blue
Beard;" Belmore, Mr. Odell, and Mr. Leonard Boyne all
essay to burlesque Mr. Irving as Hamlet; and Miss Pattie
Laverne plays the hero in Mr. Burnand's "Ixion Re-Wheeled."
A "Robinson Crusoe," by Mr. Farnie, at the
Folly in 1876, brings to the front a droll Will Atkins in the
form of Mr. George Barrett.</p>

<p>In 1877, at the Gaiety, Edward Terry joins Miss Farren
and Mr. Royce, and in 1878 Selina Dolaro and G. W.
Anson are playing at the Folly in "Another Drink," while
Alma Stanley and Charles Groves are playing in "Venus"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
at the Royalty. Miss Kate Vaughan, at the Gaiety, is
already beginning to revolutionise stage dancing, making
it at once graceful and decorous. At the Royalty, in
1880, are Miss Kate Lawler and Mr. Frank Wyatt; at
the Gaiety are Mr. Dallas and Miss Gilchrist. In 1882,
Mr. Toole, who has not been seen in burlesque for
some time, takes part in a skit on rural melodrama. A
year later Mr. Harry Monkhouse figures at the Gaiety;
Mr. E. D. Ward and Miss Marie Linden first show, at
Toole's, their talent for travestie; and Miss Laura
Linden does the same thing at the Strand. In 1884
Mr. Willie Edouin and Miss Alice Atherton make, in
"The Babes," their first joint success in London; and
Mr. Edward Terry and Miss Kate Vaughan appear at the
Gaiety for the last time in burlesque.</p>

<p>It is from this point that we may date the foundation
of the New Burlesque, to which I shall return in my last
chapter. In the chapters that immediately follow we shall
be able to see how numerous were the topics essayed by
burlesque writers in the "palmy" days, and also with how
much wit and humour those writers were able, for the
most part, to charge the stories that they told and the
pictures that they presented.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"CLASSICAL" BURLESQUE.</p>


<p>Planché was not only the founder of modern burlesque:
he was the originator, in particular, of that
form of travestie which is commonly described as "classical"&mdash;which
deals with the characteristics and adventures of the
gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines, of the Greek and
Latin mythology and fable. It is true that comic pieces
on classical subjects had been played in England before
Planché brought out, at the Olympic, his "Olympic Revels"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
(January 1831). But these pieces were not burlesques in
the present-century sense of the word. Take, for example,
the "Midas" of Kane O'Hara, which, produced in 1762,
remained popular for so many years, and will always be
remembered as including the once famous <span class="nwrp">ditty:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pray, goody, please to moderate the rancour of your tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why flash those sparks of fury from your eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember, where the judgment's weak the prejudice is strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A stranger why will you despise?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The gods and goddesses are presented in "Midas" in a
light more or less ludicrous, and the dialogue, songs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
choruses are flavoured with contemporary allusion, more or
less humorous. But the form given to the work is that of
the old-fashioned burletta. Indeed, the chief merit of
"Midas," from a historical point of view, lies in the fact
that it was its successful revival, with Mme. Vestris as
Apollo, which, coupled with the publication of Colman
junior's story, "The Sun-Poker," suggested to Planché
the composition of his first "classical" burlesque. This
had for subject the story of Prometheus and Pandora,
and was remarkable, not only for the smooth flow of its
versification and the general refinement of its tone, but also
for the accuracy and consistency of the costumes, which
were throughout "classical," and therefore in strong contrast
to the haphazard, incongruous attire in which "classical"
characters had hitherto been exhibited on the comic boards.</p>

<p>Prometheus and Pandora, I may note, figured later&mdash;in
1865&mdash;as the leading personages in Mr. Reece's "Prometheus,
or the Man on the Rock,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in which the writer
differed from his predecessor in admitting into his dialogue
a large infusion of the punning element. In this direction
Mr. Reece has always been proficient. Here are a few
specimens of his work, picked out at <span class="nwrp">random:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Planché's "Olympic Revels" proved so brilliantly successful
that he was encouraged to follow it up, at the end
of the year, with a companion composition&mdash;"Olympic
Devils, or Orpheus and Eurydice." In this work, James
Bland, the son of the lady who "created" Planché's Coquetinda,
made his first appearance in burlesque, and among
the female Bacchantes who took part in the groupings was
a clever young girl, named Leonora Pincott, who was destined
one day to be a great public favourite as "Mrs. Alfred
Wigan." In "Olympic Devils" Planché's style is seen to
excellent effect. Note, as an instance, the remarks addressed
by Minos, Lord <em>Low</em> Chancellor, to the <span class="nwrp">Fates:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Elsewhere Orpheus says to <span class="nwrp">Eurydice:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i0">I am a lunatic for lack of thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad as a March hare&mdash;oh, <i>ma chère</i> amie!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Planché had a higher wit than that of punning. His
satire and sarcasm have an agreeable, because not too
pungent, cynicism&mdash;as in such little scraps of song as this
(following upon the scene in which Orpheus, hearing that
his wife is flirting with Pluto, cannot resist looking back
at her and thus consigning her again to Pluto's tender
<span class="nwrp">mercies):&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Orpheus.</i> I have looked back&mdash;in your snare I am caught, sir&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i8">When your wife flirts behind you, to look straight before?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In after years H. J. Byron wrote two burlesques on the
legend of Orpheus and his wife, both of them produced at
the Strand Theatre,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and it is notable that when Planché
made, in 1865, at the Haymarket, his last appearance as a
writer of extravaganza, it fell to his lot to treat once more
of Orpheus and his surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Planché's third classical burlesque was "The Paphian
Bower, or Venus and Adonis," in which Benjamin Webster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
was seen for the first time in this class of histrionic work.
Mme. Vestris, of course, was Venus, and in the course
of the piece had to sing this eminently clever parody of
"Sally in our <span class="nwrp">Alley":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of all the swains that are so smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I dearly love Adonis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pit-a-pat will go my heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">bray rides so capitàlly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, he's the darling of my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he hunts in our valley!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jupiter and the neighbours all<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, notwithstanding, I with him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Contemplate matrimony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he can play on the <em>cornet</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sing most musically;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a Duke in all the land<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can beat him at "Aunt Sally."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Venus and Adonis have always been great favourites with
the producers of travestie. Among those who have made
them the central figures of burlesque are Mr. Burnand,
whose work was brought out in 1864, and Mr. Edward
Rose, whose "Venus," written in collaboration with the
Mr. Augustus Harris, and first performed at the Royalty
in 1879 (with Miss Nelly Bromley as the heroine), was
re-written for revival, and finally taken as the foundation
of a third production in 1880.</p>

<p>In "The Deep, Deep Sea," brought out in 1833, Planché
selected as the basis of his work the story of Perseus and
Andromeda. He treated it with his usual reverence for
the original legend. He represented Juno and the Nereids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as being angry with King Cepheus, and sending the sea-serpent
to devastate his shores. James Vining played the
Serpent, and his approach was announced to the monarch
in the following <span class="nwrp">strain:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mighty monarch, stir your stumps as if Old Nick were following:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A serpent with an awful twist has landed on your shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our gallant soldiers, guns and all, by regiments he's swallowing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And munching up musicians and composers by the <em>score</em>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of counsel learned in the law but <em>brief</em> work he is making&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Apothecaries just as they were pills, sir, he is taking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He snaps the parson right in two, as well as his oration;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ere the beadle bolts the door, he bolts the congregation!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mighty monarch, stir your stumps, for court and caravansary<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are emptied of inhabitants all crazy with affright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monster he is longer far than any suit in Chancery,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And beats the Court of Aldermen, by chalks, for appetite!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Serpent, when he arrives, introduces himself to the
king in an engaging <span class="nwrp">fashion:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All bones but yours will rattle when I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the sea serpent from America.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mayhap you've heard that I've been round the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I guess I'm round it now, mister, twice curled....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the monsters through the deep that splash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm "number one" to all immortal smash.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I lie down, and would my length unroll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There ar'n't half room enough 'twixt pole and pole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, I grow so long that I've a notion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must be measured soon for a new ocean.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The exaggeration which is so characteristic of American
humour is here happily satirised. In another passage,
Perseus, addressing himself to Andromeda, sings a neatly
turned parody of "We met&mdash;'twas in a <span class="nwrp">Crowd":&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We met! 'twas at the ball,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You smiled, and said, "Dear Sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>You</em> may speak to my mother."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1861 Perseus and Andromeda reappeared upon the
comic stage at the instance of William Brough, who made
them the hero and heroine of a burlesque at the St. James's.</p>

<p>The story of Telemachus was the subject which engaged
the attention of Planché immediately after he had done with
Perseus. Fénelon's tale had become extremely familiar to
the British schoolboy, who at that time was not thought
to have "grounded" himself sufficiently in French until he
had read the narrative in the original. Hence Planché's
"Telemachus, or the Island of Calypso,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> concerning which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the author took credit to himself once more for having
"preserved the well-known plot with the most reverential
fidelity." Ten years later the same subject was treated in
the "Telemachus" of Stirling Coyne, played at the Adelphi
with Miss Woolgar in the title-part, Wright as Calypso
(a ballet-dancer!) and Paul Bedford as the hero's Mentor
or "tor-Mentor." In 1863 the story of the parents of
Telemachus proved attractive to Mr. Burnand, whose
"Patient Penelope" made her curtsey at the Strand, to be
followed at the St. James's, two years later, by the same
writer's "Ulysses."</p>

<p>Still tracing the course of Planché's labours in burlesque,
we come next to the production, at the Haymarket in 1845,
of "The Golden Fleece"&mdash;perhaps, on the whole, the most
delightful of the series. In this ingenious and brilliant piece,
the two parts of which were entitled respectively "Jason
in Colchis" and "Medea in Corinth," Planché had taken
the narrative of Apollonius Rhodius and the tragedy of
Euripides, and had built upon them a composition in
which he sought less to cast ridicule upon the legends
selected than to travestie what he called "the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i>
of the classical period, which really illustrates the old proverbial
observation that there is but one step from the
sublime to the ridiculous." He brought again upon the stage
the ancient Chorus, incarnated in a single person, who
explained the action of the piece as it went on, not hesitating
even to interrupt it when the humorous opportunity
occurred. Charles Mathews undertook the part, heralded
by a jocose announcement on the "bills" to the effect that
"The lessee has, regardless of expense, engaged Mr. Charles
Mathews to represent the whole body of the chorus, rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
at least fifty-nine male voices entirely unnecessary." In the
opening scene, the Chorus thus described his <span class="nwrp">functions:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Friends, countrymen, lovers, first listen to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm the Chorus; <em>whatever</em> you hear or you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you don't understand, I shall rise to explain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a famous old fashion that's come up again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will be of great service to many fine plays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nobody can understand nowadays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think what a blessing if found intervening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the author himself scarcely knows his own meaning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may reap from it, too, an advantage still further:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When an actor is bent upon marriage or murther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Chorus his scheme he in confidence mentions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Stead of telling the pit all his secret intentions;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wondrous improvement you all will admit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the secret is just as well heard by the pit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i lang="la">Verbum sat.</i>&mdash;To the wise I'll not put one more word in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or instead of a Chorus, they'll think me a <em>burden</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later in the piece, announcing the approach of King Æetes
(Bland), the Chorus interposed <span class="nwrp">with:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Æetes comes, looking as black as thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you hear the cause you'll say "No wonder";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Jason, aided by Medea's spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has done the trick, and done the King as well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll think, perhaps, you should have seen him do it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 't isn't classical&mdash;you'll hear, not view it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever taxed their talents or their means,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These sly old Grecians did <em>behind</em> the scenes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, fired with their example, boldly we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beg you'll suppose whate'er you wish to see.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elsewhere occurred this famous bit of badinage between
King and <span class="nwrp">Chorus:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Chorus.</i> Be calm, great King&mdash;'tis destiny's decree.</p>
<p><i>Æetes.</i> How dare you talk of destiny to me!<br />
What right have you with such advice to bore us?</p>
<p><i>Chorus.</i> Sir, I'm the Chorus.</p>
<p><i>Æetes.</i><span class="i7">Sir, you're indecorous.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>In the course of the piece Mathews sang, among other
things, an excellent ditty, to the tune of "The Tight Little
<span class="nwrp">Island":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Twas very ungrateful, you'll say, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, alas! of the world it's the way, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all a friend can, you have done for a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'll cut you quite dead the next day, sir.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But perhaps the most successful parody in "The Golden
Fleece" was that on "The Fine Old English Gentleman,"
assigned to Mme. Vestris as Medea. This is worth
quoting in <span class="nwrp">full:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'll tell you a sad tale of the life I've been led of late,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"Medea," it will be remembered, was the title and subject
of a burlesque by Robert Brough, brought out at the
Olympic in 1856, with Robson in the title-part, Emery as
Creon (King of Corinth), and Julia St. George as Jason.
Medea ("the best of mothers, with a brute of a husband,"
as the sub-title has it) was one of Robson's most impressive
<i>rôles</i>, being charged at more than one point (notably in the
closing scene, which was played by all the characters in
serious fashion) with real tragic intensity. In the lighter
vein were such episodes as the duet with Jason (to the air
of "Robinson Crusoe"), which I quote as illustrative of the
neatness and humour with which Brough constructed such
<span class="nwrp">trifles:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The last of Planché's classical burlesques was produced
at the Lyceum in 1848. It was on the subject of "Theseus
and Ariadne," and was fortunate in the services of Charles
Mathews as Dædalus. In this character Mathews sang a
song which Planché had written for private performance
and had brought "down to date" for the occasion. It is
one of the happiest <i>mélanges</i> ever put together, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm still in a flutter&mdash;I scarcely can utter<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The words to my tongue that come dancing&mdash;come dancing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've had such a dream that I'm sure it must seem<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To incredulous ears like romancing&mdash;romancing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt it was brought on by that Madame Wharton,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who muddled me quite with her models&mdash;her models;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Madame Tussaud, who in waxwork can show<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of all possible people the noddles&mdash;the noddles.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The only song, of the kind, worthy to compare with this,
is the description of the Heavy Dragoon sung by Colonel
Calverly in the "Patience" of Mr. Gilbert, who, as a
master of light badinage and intricate rhythm and rhyme,
is the lineal descendant of the author of "Theseus and
Ariadne."</p>

<p>After Planché, the most notable of the deceased writers
of "classical" burlesque is undoubtedly Francis Talfourd.
Planché's knowledge of the Greek mythology and drama
was admittedly derived from translations and from dictionaries;
Talfourd was a university man, and had an
at-first-hand acquaintance with the masterpieces which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
so skilfully travestied. The marks of this are visible in
all his "classical" pieces, and notably in the first of them&mdash;"Alcestis,
the Original Strong-minded Woman, being a
most Shameless Misinterpretation of the Greek drama of
Euripides." This was played at the Strand in 1850. The
"argument" prefixed to it is an excellent bit of <span class="nwrp">punning:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Admetus, being due to Death, and as such totally unprepared to
take himself up, is about to betake himself down, according to previous
arrangement, when Orcus, who had meanwhile been trying his mean
wiles on Alcestis (Admetus' very much better half), expresses himself
willing to receive her as a substitute; her husband, friends, and relations
not feeling quite so disposed to be disposed of. Alcestis, however,
consents, packs up her traps, and then obligingly goes packing down
those of Orcus. At this melancholy juncture, Hercules chances to be
passing through Thessaly, on his return from his provincial engagements,
and, having a knack of turning up a trump at a <em>rub</em>, plays his
club so judiciously as to retake the queen, in spite of the deuce, and
restores her to her family and friends.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the dialogue of "Alcestis" we have such quips as
<span class="nwrp">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">E'en like a detonator down he goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay the <em>debt o' natur</em> which he owes.<br /></span>

<p>In 1851 came "Thetis and Peleus," in which Talfourd
had a collaborator. In 1857 he produced, at the Haymarket,
"Atalanta, or the Three Golden Apples," inserting
in the "bill" a comic note to the effect that "Lest he
should be accused of murdering a good subject, the Author
begs to state that it was <span class="smcap">Foun' Ded</span> from unknown causes
many years ago." Miss Oliver was the Atalanta, and
Miss Wilton the Cupid. Among the other characters is
Mississarris, Atalanta's duenna, "the Guard of the Old
Greek Stage, with, in this instance, an eye to the Males,
subsequently attached to the old Coach, Paidagogos,"
played by Compton. One of the cleverest scenes in the
piece is designed and written in parody of the balcony
scene in "Romeo and Juliet." Hippomenes, the hero,
is seen climbing "over the garden wall," guitar in hand.
Descending, he <span class="nwrp">soliloquises:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He jests at scars who ne'er in climbing hit upon<br /></span>

<p>Elsewhere Hippomenes delivers himself of a superexcellent
pun. Some one says to him, referring to his studies,&mdash;"But

<p>After "Atalanta"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> came Talfourd's "Pluto and Proserpine,
or the Belle and the Pomegranate," played at the Haymarket
in 1858, and his "Electra in an Electric Light,"
performed at the Haymarket the year following. In "Pluto
and Proserpine," as in his other pieces, the original myth
is followed closely. One passage supplies a happy parody
of the famous "palace-lifting-to-eternal-summer" speech in
"The Lady of Lyons." Pluto has appeared to Proserpine
as a young man, and has laid siege to her heart in proper
form. He is careful not to disclose his identity. At last
Proserpine <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But Talfourd, like Planché, could rise above mere <i>jeux
d'esprit</i>, and furnish, when necessary, bits of persiflage
which deserve to linger in the memory. Thus, in one of
the scenes, Pluto addresses Cerberus in a fashion intended
to suggest Launce's colloquy with his dog in "The Two
Gentlemen of <span class="nwrp">Verona":&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I have already referred to three classical burlesques by
H. J. Byron. A fourth exists in the "original classical
pastoral" called "Pan," which first saw the light at the
Adelphi in 1865. Pan, it may be recorded, was impersonated
by Mr. J. L. Toole. He had a good deal to say, and much
of it was in the form of <i>jeux de mots</i>. Take, for example,
the passage in which Pan discovers that Syrinx, whom he
loves, is in love with Narcissus. He calls down thunder
from the skies; and then follows this <span class="nwrp">tirade:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Narcissus.</i> What means this sudden dreadful change, I wonder?<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Pan.</i><span class="indent10"> Ah, Pan!</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">With murrain all your sheep rot in their pens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pip shall finish all your cocks and hens;<br /></span>

<p>This is a very fair specimen of Byron's rather careless
method; and another is at hand in the following lines,
which are spoken after the Carian captain has shown to
Pan a jar of <span class="nwrp">wine:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i0">While this is still so gently o'er me stealing.<br /></span>

<p>To the burlesques by William Brough already mentioned
may be added "Endymion, or the Naughty Boy who cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
for the Moon" (St. James's, 1860), and "Pygmalion, or the
Statue Fair" (Strand, 1867). The former,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of course, has
to do with the fabled fondness of Diana for Endymion, and
<i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. The goddess sees the youth lying asleep upon
Mount Latmos, and, descending, kisses him:-</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Strange weakness&mdash;thus my beams so bright to dim!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should <em>be more</em> myself&mdash;not <em>beam o'er</em> him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods all mock my silvery splendour paling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not silvery, but irony, <em>their</em> railing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paling and railing!&mdash;what dread fears that calls up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their <em>bitter raillery</em> suggesting <em>All's up</em>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before Endymion has seen Diana, he is asked by Actæon
whether he is in love; to which he replies:-</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Oh, no! We men of fashion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have long ago forsworn the tender passion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can't afford it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Actæ.</i> <span class="indent6">Why not?</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Endym.</i><span class="indent8"> Well, a wife</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">May suit folks in the lower walks of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in our station, what girls seek in marriage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not a <em>walk</em> in life;&mdash;they want a carriage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, what with dress and crinoline extensive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sex which should be <em>dear</em> becomes <em>expensive</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once hearts were trumps;&mdash;that suit no more we follow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since a good suit of diamonds beats them hollow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here he drops into a parody of "Our Hearts are not our
<span class="nwrp">Own to Give":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our hearts we've not alone to give,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some hundreds sterling, at the least,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should with the fond hearts go.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When, again, Actæon asks Endymion whether he ever
shoots, he replies, "No, I don't care about <span class="nwrp">it":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Actæ.</i> Not care for shooting, man? What's life without it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All nature shoots. Say, what's the earliest thing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The stars shoot in the sky&mdash;nay, I've heard say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folks sometimes shoot the moon on quarter-day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the <i lang="la">personæ</i> in the piece is Pan, whom we find
addressing the fauns in this punning <span class="nwrp">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh long-ear'd, but short-sighted fauns, desist;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Trust, then, to Pan your troubles to remove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warming-Pan he'll to your courage prove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prophet, he foresees the ills you'd fear;<br /></span>

<p>In "Pygmalion"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> we are asked to suppose that Venus is
indignant with the sculptor for his lack of susceptibility to
female charms. Cupid therefore undertakes to punish
him by making him fall in love with his new statue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Galatea. To this statue Venus, at Pygmalion's request,
gives life; but she withholds the power of loving. Galatea,
therefore, is for ever slighting the sculptor's affection.
Here is the opening of their first interview, which the
curious may compare with the similar situation in Mr.
Gilbert's "Pygmalion and Galatea:"&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the end, Psyche infuses soul into Galatea, and she
and the sculptor understand each other.</p>

<p>In 1883 Mr. H. P. Stephens submitted to Gaiety
audiences a one-act piece which he called "Galatea, or
Pygmalion Re-versed." In this Galatea was the sculptor,
and Pygmalion the statue; and with Miss Farren as the
former, and Mr. Edward Terry as the latter, the result was
eminently laughable. Cynisca, by the way, was turned into

<p>Two mythological burlesques stand to the credit of
Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett&mdash;"The Son of the Sun, or the
Fate of Phaeton," played at the Fitzroy Theatre so long ago
as 1834; and "The Three Graces," a two-act piece, seen
at the Princess's in 1843, with Oxberry, Wright, and Paul
Bedford in the cast. Both of these travesties are very
smoothly and gracefully written, with fewer puns than the
author afterwards permitted himself. "The Three Graces,"
moreover, is not very prolific in contemporary allusion;
though here and there, as in the following passage,
between the heroines&mdash;Aglaia, Thalia, and Euphrosyne&mdash;there
is some gentle <span class="nwrp">satire:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Burnand has written more "classical" burlesques than
any man living or dead. A university man, like Talfourd,
he has displayed complete mastery of mythologic themes,
submitting them to ingenious perversion, and adorning them
with a wealth of pun and parody of which it is impossible, in
these brief limits, to give more than a few samples. He has
shown special interest in the legends connected with the
siege of Troy,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> producing three burlesques more or less
connected with that event. First, in 1860, came "Dido," at
the St. James's, with Charles Young as the heroine; next,
in 1866, "Paris, or Vive Lemprière," at the Strand;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> next,
in 1867, "The Latest Edition of Helen, or Taken from the
Greek," at Liverpool.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Helen of Troy, I may note, <i>en
parenthèse</i>, had been the heroine of two other travesties: one
by Vincent Amcotts&mdash;"Fair Helen" (Oxford, 1862); the
other by Mr. Robert Reece&mdash;"Our Helen" (Gaiety, 1884).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>In "Dido," Mr. Burnand's genius for word-play is agreeably
manifested. I take some lines at <span class="nwrp">random:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1863 Mr. Burnand brought out, at the Royalty, "Ixion,
or the Man at the Wheel,"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which proved to be one of the
happiest of his efforts. This he followed up, at the same
theatre, two years later, with "Pirithous," in which the
adventures of Ixion's son were as humorously depicted. In
the interval he had produced at the Olympic "Cupid and
Psyche" (December, 1864), a burlesque on an ever-popular
subject. Years before&mdash;so early as 1837&mdash;a piece called
"Cupid," written by Joseph Graves, had been represented
at the Queen's and Strand, with Wild and Miss Malcolm at
the one house and Hammond and Miss Daly at the other
as the God of Love and his beloved. In "Cupid," however,
there was little verbal wit. The god figured as a gay
deceiver, who had promised marriage to Psyche, but had
refused to "implement" the undertaking. Whereupon
Jupiter decides that Cupid shall be shot dead by Psyche;
but she, using the god's own arrows, does but transfix him
with the love she yearns for. Cupid sings, early in the piece,
a parody of "The Sea! the Sea!" beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Psyché! Psyché! my own Psyché,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pretty, fair, and ever free!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, otherwise, Graves's "book" is not particularly brilliant,
Though smoothly written and fairly brisk in action.</p>

<p>In "Cupid and Psyche" Mr. Burnand made Psyche
the daughter of a king, who, because she will not marry
and thus relieve him of the anxiety caused by a certain
Prophecy, chains her to a rock on the sea-shore. To this
he is incited by Venus, who regards Psyche as her rival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
in beauty. Psyche is duly rescued and espoused by Cupid,
who (as in the old myth) remains invisible to her until
her curiosity gets the better of her prudence; and, in the
end, Venus abates her enmity, and the union of the pair
is duly recognised. In one place, Psyche, entering, distractedly,
in search of Cupid, <span class="nwrp">cries:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A river! I debate with myself wedder<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bacchus.</i> "An 'Arrow boy!"&mdash;egad, that joke's a n<em>eat 'un</em>.<br /></span>

<p>Among other "classical" burlesques may be mentioned
Mr. Burnand's "Arion," seen at the Strand in 1871, with
Mr. Edward Terry, Mr. Harry Paulton, and Miss Augusta
Thomson; and H. B. Farnie's "Vesta," produced at the
St. James's in the same year, with Mr. John Wood and Mr.
Lionel Brough. Mr. Burnand's "Sappho" (1866), and
"Olympic Games" (1867), also call for mention. John
Brougham's "Life in the Clouds" belongs to 1840; Tom
Taylor's "Diogenes and his Lantern" to 1849; the Brothers
Brough's "Sphinx" to the same year; William Brough's
"Hercules and Omphale" to 1864; and Mr. Reece's
"Agamemnon and Cassandra, or The Prophet and Loss
of Troy," to 1868.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BURLESQUE OF FAËRIE.</p>


<p>As Planché was, in effect, the Father of Classical
Burlesque, so was he also, even more irrefragably,
the Father of the Burlesque of Faërie&mdash;of the fairy tales of
the nursery, and especially of those derived from French
sources. Memorable, indeed, was the production of
Planché's "Riquet with the Tuft<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>"; this piece was the
precursor of something like twenty others from the same
pen, all written on the same principle and in the same
vein. Planché had been to Paris, and had there seen
Potier playing in "Riquet à la Houppe." He came home
and straightway wrote his own version of the story, partly in
verse, partly in prose, having in Charles Mathews a Riquet
not equal indeed to Potier, but with obvious merits of his
own. Vestris was the Princess Emeralda, and James Bland
Green Horn the Great&mdash;Rebecca Isaacs, then only a little
girl, being the Mother Bunch. The result was complete
success, carrying with it great encouragement to the
dramatist to persevere in the new path on which he had
entered.</p>

<p>These fairy pieces of Planché's were not burlesques quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in the sense in which his classical pieces were, but they
belong, nevertheless, to the burlesque <i>genre</i>. Each treats
lightly and humorously a story already in existence; each
includes parodies of popular lyrics, as well as songs written
to the airs of popular ditties; and the burlesque spirit
animates the whole. Every now and then, the writer, rising
superior to parody, produces a lyric which has a definite
accent of its own. Here, for example, in "Riquet with the
Tuft," is a song accorded to the grotesque and misshapen
hero. It has genuine wit as well as genial <span class="nwrp">philosophy:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm a strange-looking person, I am,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And tho' with this odd pair of pegs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My motions I own serpentine are,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I'm delighted she's chosen the outer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus on all things I put a good face,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And warms towards each fellow-creature!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>The origin of "Riquet with the Tuft" is to be found in
Perrault's "Contes de ma Mère l'Oye." Planché went to
the same source for his "Puss in Boots: an original,
comical, <em>mews</em>-ical fairy burletta" (Olympic, 1837), in which
Charles Mathews was an incomparable Puss, with Bland as
Pumpkin the Prodigious, Vestris as the Marquis of Carabas,
and Brougham as a very Irish ogre. In this there was a
good deal of prose dialogue, of which the following scene
between Puss and the three maids-of-honour may be taken
as a diverting <span class="nwrp">specimen:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Chatterina.</i> You're in the army, I presume?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> No, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Chatt.</i> Why, you wear moustaches.</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> Yes, ma'am, yes; but that's because&mdash;because I can't help it,
you see. I belong to a club, and all the members are obliged to wear
them.</p>

<p><i>Chatt.</i> What club?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> It's a sort of Catch Club.</p>

<p><i>Arietta.</i> What, musical?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> Very.</p>

<p><i>Ari.</i> And where do you meet?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> We meet alternately upon each other's roof.</p>

<p><i>Skipperella.</i> <em>Upon</em> each other's roof?&mdash;that's quite a new step.</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> I beg pardon, did I say <em>upon</em>? I meant <em>under</em>.</p>

<p><i>Ari.</i> You can sing, then?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> I can squall a little, <i>à la</i> Cat-oni.</p>

<p><i>Ari.</i> Who taught you?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> Cat-alani.</p>

<p><i>Skip.</i> And dance, too?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> I remember the time when I would have run anywhere after
a ball.</p>

<p><i>Skip.</i> What is your favourite dance?</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> The Cat-alonian Cat-choucha.</p>

<p><i>Chat.</i> Well, never mind about singing and dancing; suppose we fix
upon some game to pass away the time, at which we can all play?</p>

<p><i>Ari.</i> I'm content.</p>

<p><i>Skip.</i> And I.</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> And I. What shall it be?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Chat.</i> "Puss in the Corner."</p>

<p><i>Puss.</i> No, no, I don't like that.</p>

<p><i>Chat.</i> Choose one yourself, then.</p>

piece called Noodlehead IX.; the Princesses are named
Biddi, Coobiddi, and Chickabiddi; and there are two
woodcutters called Gnarl and Knot. The puns in the
dialogue on the word <em>cat</em> are even more numerous than in
the older piece, and somewhat more varied. As <span class="nwrp">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>One of the prettiest and wittiest of Planché's adaptations
from Perrault's store was "The Sleeping Beauty in the
Wood," seen at Covent Garden in 1840. The Beauty was
the Princess Is-a-Belle&mdash;of course, Mme. Vestris; the
inevitable King&mdash;Thomas Noddy of No-Land&mdash;was the
inevitable Bland; James Vining was Prince Perfect; and
Brougham was a woodcutter&mdash;one Larry O'Log. But the
most whimsical character in the piece was played by Harley&mdash;the
Baron Factotum, "Great-Grand-Lord-Everything,"
who may be compared with Pooh-Bah in Mr. Gilbert's
"Mikado." In "The Mikado," Ko-Ko is "Lord High
Executioner of Titipu," and Pooh-Bah is "Lord High
Everything Else"&mdash;he is "First Lord of the Treasury,
Lord Chief Justice, Commander-in-Chief, Lord High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Admiral, Master of the Buckhounds, Groom of the Backstairs,
Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor, both acting
and elect, all rolled into one." The Baron Factotum is
even more embarrassed with offices and duties. As he
says at one <span class="nwrp">juncture:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I shall go crazy. Ye who sigh for place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold and profit by my piteous case.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Lord High Chamberlain, I slumber never;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Lord High Steward, in a stew I'm ever!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Lord High Constable, I watch all day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Lord High Treasurer, I've the deuce to pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Great Grand Cupbearer, I'm handled queerly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Great Grand Carver, I'm cut up severely.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In other States the honours are divided,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here they're one and all to me confided;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They've buckled Fortune on my back&mdash;until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I really feel particularly ill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young man, avoid the cares from State that spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And don't you be a Great Grand anything.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then sings, to the tune of "Where the bee <span class="nwrp">sucks":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who would be a Great Grand Lord High,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the blame on him must lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everywhere for him they cry,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Verily, verily! Few would live now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the honours beneath which I bow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The programme of the "The Sleeping Beauty" bore the
following <span class="nwrp">notice:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In strict accordance with the Modern School of Melodramatic
Composition, Eighteen years are to be supposed to have elapsed
between the First and Second Parts; One Hundred years between
the Second and Third Parts; and considerably more than One Hundred
after the piece is over.</p></blockquote>

<p>Planché went again to Perrault&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
for his "Blue Beard" (1839) and his "Discreet Princess"
(1855). The last named (from "L'Adroite Princesse")
was notable as including in its cast Robson as Prince
Richcraft, and Emery as Gander the Stupendous. In "Blue
Beard" Bland played the Baron Abomelique (the hero),
Mme. Vestris the heroine (Fleurette), and John Brougham,
the actor-dramatist, an Irish character&mdash;the O'Shac O'Back.
How often has this fascinating subject been dealt with
since! Dozens of pantomimes have had it for a basis;
the burlesques founded on it are not quite so numerous.
The best known are those by H. J. Byron (1860) and
Mr. Burnand (1883); there are also two others by H. T.
Arden and Frank Green.</p>

<p>But it was to the "Contes des Fées" of Madame
D'Aulnoy that Planché was most largely indebted for his
fairy stories. The list (extending from 1842 to 1854) is
quite an imposing one. First came "Fortunio, and his
Seven Gifted Servants," based on "Belle-Belle, ou le
Chevalier Fortuné." Next, "The Invisible Prince, or the
Island of Tranquil Delights," taken from "Le Prince
Lutin." "Le Rameau d'Or" suggested "The Golden
Branch," and "The King of Peacocks"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> had its origin in
"La Princesse Rosette." From "Le Serpentin Vert" was
derived "The Island of Jewels"; from "L'Oiseau Bleu,"
"King Charming, or the Blue Bird of Paradise"; from
"La Grenouille Bienfaisante," "The Queen of the Frogs";
from "La Biche au Bois,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "The Prince of Happy Land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
or the Fawn in the Forest"; from "La Princesse Carpillon,"
"Once upon a Time there were Two Kings"; and from
"Le Nain Jeune," "The Yellow Dwarf and the King of
the Gold Mines." "Beauty and the Beast" was taken from
a tale by Mme. le Prince de Beaumont; but Planché
claimed that the treatment was wholly new. He had
Vestris for his Beauty, Harrison the tenor for his Beast,
and Bland for his Sir Aldgate Pump, the father of Beauty.
"The Good Woman in the Wood" was from a story by
Mme. de la Force; and "Young and Handsome" from
a faërie by the Countess de Murat. "Graciosa and
Percinet" likewise had a French origin.</p>

<p>It was, however, in each case only for the fable that
Planché had to give thanks: everything else&mdash;even in most
instances the nomenclature&mdash;was his own. And that nomenclature
was often very ingenious and amusing. Thus, in
"Fortunio," we have an impecunious noble called Baron
Dunover (played by Morris Barnett). In "The Invisible
Prince" the name of the Queen of Allaquiz is Blouzabella;
her son is the Infante Furibond;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and among her courtiers
are the Marquis of Anysidos, Count Palava Torquemova
(who introduces the ambassadors), and Don Moustachez
de Haro y Barbos (Captain of the Guard). In the same
piece, the Princess of the Island of Tranquil Delights is
called Xquisitelittlepet, and her ladies in waiting are Toxaloto-tittletattle
and Itsaprettipetticoat. Soyez Tranquille (with
a clever suggestion of Soyer) is the <i>chef de cuisine</i> in "The
King of the Peacocks," in which there is also an Irishman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
The O'Don't Know Who, and a German, the Baroness Von
Huggermugger. Planché's kings and queens have mostly
comic names. There is Giltgingerbread the Great, with
Tinsellina, his consort, in "The Island of Jewels." There
is Henpeckt the Hundredth in "King Charming"; there is
Fulminoso the Pugnacious in "The Queen of the Frogs";
there is Periwigulus the Proud in "Once upon a Time
there were Two Kings." Henpeckt, again, has a valet called
Natty, and a porter called Nobby. Elsewhere we come
across an usher named Antirumo, an Indian named Tan-tee-vee
(of the tribe of Tal-hee-ho), and an evil genius
named Abaddun. The Yellow Dwarf is christened, very
appropriately, Gambogie.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"The Yellow Dwarf," it may here be chronicled, is the
title of a burlesque by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett and by
Mr. Robert Reece; A'Beckett's being produced in 1842,
Planché's in 1854, and Mr. Reece's in 1882. "Beauty and
the Beast" has been made the subject of travestie by Mr.
Burnand. The "Fortunio" of Planché was also rivalled in
the "Lady Belle Belle, or Fortunio and his Seven Magic
Men" of H. J. Byron (Adelphi, 1863).<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This last was in a
thoroughly H. J. Byronic vein, with a Count Collywobbol
among its characters and the usual supply of puns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
parodies. Here are a few of the best of the puns. The
Princess Volante is a very Atalanta in her fondness for race
<span class="nwrp">running:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">I'll run a race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With any living ped, through wind or rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some like what's handsome&mdash;I prefer the <em>plain</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have this morning run a spanking heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two miles in just ten minutes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Prin.</i> Everything pedal has its charms for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd have gone miles the great Miss <em>Foote</em> to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tastes are visible e'en at my meals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My favourite fish, of course, are <em>soles</em> and <em>eels</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pota<em>toes</em> I consider are <em>A-oners</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I've a preference for scarlet-<em>runners</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when at children's parties I am present,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think a game at four-<em>feits</em> very pleasant.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The White Cat," by Planché (1842), has among its
<i lang="la">personæ</i> Wunsuponatyme, King of Neverminditsnamia;
Prince Paragon; and Jingo, a Court fool. In "The Fair
One with the Golden Locks" (1843), the King is called
Lachrymoso,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the woman of the bedchamber Molly-mopsa.
Finally, there is "The Seven Champions of
Christendom" (1849), in which Charles Mathews played
Charles Wag, Esq., "in attendance on" St. George of
England. With this ends the list of Planché's compositions
of this kind&mdash;a remarkable contribution to the stage
literature of wit and humour.</p>

<p>From Planché's "Seven Champions of Christendom" to
the "St. George and the Dragon" of Gilbert Abbott
a'Beckett (1845) and the "Sir George and a Dragon, or We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
are Seven" of Mr. Burnand (1856) is a natural and easy
transition. In A'Beckett's piece, Kalyba, the sorceress, has
stolen St. George when a child, in order that he might fall
in love with her, and so rescue her from prophesied destruction.
Getting rid of her with a wave of her own wand, he
turns up with his fellow Champions at Memphis, where
King Ptolemy is in a state of impecuniosity, the Dragon
having swallowed up all his resources. The monster demands
the King's daughter Sabra, but St. George contrives
to trick him out of the legal securities he holds, and eventually
destroys him by the power of the steam press. There
is a vein of allegory running through the piece, which has,
however, its share of <i>jeux de mots</i>. Thus, Kalyba's handmaid
says to <span class="nwrp">her:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your hair, my lady, 's getting rather dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of the Russian balsam shall I try?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Kaly.</i> Well, p'raps you may&mdash;yet no&mdash;upon the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anything Russian's hurtful to the <em>Pole</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very thought my nervous system shocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! would that mine were like Chubb's&mdash;safety locks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I turn grey, I'd bid the world good-bye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Maid.</i> If you turn grey, it would be time to <em>dye</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elsewhere there is some sarcasm at the expense of the
newspapers. St. George says to <span class="nwrp">Sabra:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These evening papers, blow the horn and cry them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inviting every one to come and buy them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the way the sort of thing is done&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">Crying</i>) Se-cond edition here! the <cite>Memphis Sun</cite>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondrous intelligence! for here you have in it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sudden resignation of the Cabinet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sab.</i> The Cabinet resigned!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>St. G.</i><span class="indent7">No, that's mere vapour!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must say something, just to sell the paper.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>In Mr. Burnand's version, which is the longer of the two,
there is much more story, and there are many more puns.
St. George has not so prominent a place in the action, which
is more elaborate and varied; while the dialogue is in the
writer's most rollicking mood. Take, for example, these,
lines of Kalyba's, addressed to her <span class="nwrp">sirens:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>1st Siren.</i> Madame, there is a four-oared boat in view without a
steerer.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Kalyba</i> (using pince-nez). P'raps the Harvard crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, they don't row <em>half hard</em> enough for that;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take care! they'll go ashore upon the flat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They don't row well, but with uncommon pluck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stroke wants art&mdash;p'raps he's a stroke of luck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder where they come from! maybe Dover!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crab! as sure as <em>eggs</em> is <em>eggs</em> they're <em>ova</em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attract them here; you must not let them pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some visitors&mdash;give me my looking-glass (<i class="stage-direction">they offer telescope</i>).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that (<i class="stage-direction">they give her a hand-mirror</i>).<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Now sing, as Sirens did before us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We <em>lure</em> all here with tooral <em>looral</em> chorus.<br /></span>

<span class="i12">We're in a state of <em>comber</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Here, again, is a specimen of daring <span class="nwrp">pun-making:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vizier.</i> Sultan of Egypt, this pathetic tear<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>A popular subject with the writers of burlesque for
Christmastide has been the time-honoured one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Cinderella. The first travestie of any importance was by
Albert Smith and Kenny, seen at the Lyceum so long ago
as 1845. Next came H. J. Byron's version at the Strand in
1860, followed by Mr. Green's in 1871, Mr. Wilton Jones's
(at Leicester) in 1878, and Mr. Reece's (at the Gaiety) in
1883. A provincial burlesque on this topic was called
"Done-to-a-Cinderella," and in America there has been
a "Cinder-Ellen." Mr. Reece's piece was called, simply,
"Our Cinderella"; Mr. Jones's, "Little Cinderella."
Byron's was christened "Cinderella, or the Lover, the
Lackey, and the Little Glass Slipper." It has been a great
favourite with the public ever since it was first played with
Maria Simpson as Cinderella, Miss Oliver as the Prince
(Popetti), Miss Charlotte Saunders as his valet Dandino,
John Clarke as the Baron Balderdash, and Rogers and
Miss Lavine as Clorinda and Thisbe. Over and over again
has this clever piece of work served as the basis of pantomime
"openings" both in town and country.</p>

<p>Following the traditional story closely enough, it bristles
with the puns in which Byron revelled, and which he
poured forth with singular and somewhat exhausting lavishness.
Thus, we find Dandino <span class="nwrp">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As I've made my bed so I must lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continuing <em>bed</em> metaphor, sir&mdash;I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When quite a child, the blackest draught would drain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took my <em>pill</em>&mdash;oh! on <em>account o' pain!</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as my youthful feathers all unfurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed formed to make a <em>bold stir</em> in the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little dreamt I I should appear a valet as,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I seemed born to reign in royal <em>palliasse</em>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But suddenly the future seemed to frown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune gave me a quilt, an' <em>I'd a down</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>A little farther on Dandino and the Prince, who are
about to exchange characters for the nonce, have the
following little contest in <span class="nwrp">pun-making:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dandi.</i> But I must have a change of toggery:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This coat, you will admit, is not the best cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither is my waistcoat quite the <em>West cut</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must di<em>vest</em> myself of that affair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These buckles ain't the thing for <em>Buckley</em> Square.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Prince.</i> You shall be decked in gems of vast expense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be a gem-man in a double sense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your servant, I will wait, clean boots, wash glasses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus serve a nob, a<em>n' ob-serve</em> all that passes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dandi.</i> Then you'll obey me till you've found La Donna?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You <i>pledge</i> your princely word?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Prince</i> (<i class="stage-direction">shaking his hand heartily</i>). <em>A-pawn</em> my honour.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An even better instance of Byron's tendency to run a
pun to death is to be found in this colloquy between the
Prince and Cinderella. The latter <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cind.</i> Cinders and coals I'm so accustomed to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seem to me to tinge all things I view.<br /></span>

<p>More acceptible in, pantomime than in travestie, "Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Red Riding Hood" has nevertheless been the heroine of
at least one burlesque which has made its mark&mdash;namely,
that which Leicester Buckingham brought out at the
Lyceum just thirty years ago, under the auspices of Edmund
Falconer. He had Miss Lydia Thompson for his Blondinette
(Red Riding Hood), and Miss Cicely Nott for the young
lady's lover, Colin. The fairy element was freely introduced,
and instead of the wolf of the original there was
a Baron Reginald de Wolf ("the would-be abductor of
Blondinette, who finds he is sold when she 'ab duck'd
herself to escape him"). Here and there one gets in the
"book" a glimpse of parody; as in&mdash;</p>

<p>Passing over "Jack the Giant Killer," which H. J.
Byron made the subject of a burlesque, and "Jack and
the Beanstalk," which was treated in the same vein by the
late Charles Millward, we come to the travesties suggested
by stories in the "Arabian Nights' Entertainments." These
are fairly numerous. We may note, in particular, some
of the versions of the tales of Aladdin, Ali Baba, Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Camaralzaman, and Abon Hassan, which seem to have
offered most attractions to our comic writers.</p>

<p>The first "Aladdin" of importance was that given to the
world by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett in 1844. This was
entitled "The Wonderful Lamp in a New Light," and had
Wright for its Aladdin and Paul Bedford for its Magician.
Next in order of time comes H. J. Byron's "Aladdin, or
the Wonderful Scamp,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which has shared the fate of his
"Cinderella" as a basis for pantomimes. In this his
fondness for <i>jeux de mots</i> is as patent as ever, as well as the
ease (without conspicuous finish) with which he fitted words
to the songs of the day. Of direct parody there is little in
this "Aladdin," which, however, opens with a brief suggestion
of "The sea, the sea," sung by the <span class="nwrp">Vizier:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The tea! the tea!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I may remark that I'll be bound<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Full shillings six was this the pound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm on for tea&mdash;I'm on for tea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the savour sweet that doth belong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the curly leaf of the rough Souchong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is like nectar to me, nectar to me, nectar to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let others delight in their <i>eau de vie</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What matter, what matter? I'm on for tea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>During the last twenty years there have been four other
notable burlesques on the "Aladdin" subject&mdash;Mr. Alfred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Thompson's (1870), Mr. Green's (1874), Mr. Reece's
(1881), and Mr. Geoffrey Thorn's (1890). With Mr.
Reece's are associated pleasant memories of the bright
"street boy" of Miss Farren, Mr. Edward Terry's whimsical
magician, and the grace and refinement of Miss
Kate Vaughan's Badroulbadour.</p>

<p>Second only to "Aladdin" in acceptability both to authors
and to public, is the story of "Ali Baba, or the Forty Thieves."
Here, again, A'Beckett is (with Mark Lemon) to the fore
with the travestie called "Open Sesame, or a Night with
the Forty Thieves." This was produced at the Lyceum
Theatre, and had Mr. Frank Matthews for its Ali Baba,
Mrs. Alfred Wigan for its Ganem, Wigan himself for its
O'Mustapha (he was an Irish Mussulman), the beautiful
Miss Fairbrother for its Abdallah, Keeley for its Hassarac,
Miss Georgina Hodson for its Cogia, and Mrs. Keeley
for its Morgiana. <em>There</em> was a cast for you! How many
burlesque casts of our own time could lay claim to so much
talent and beauty? Cassim, in this piece, had to make
one admirable <span class="nwrp">pun:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such heaps of gems I never saw before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en Mortimer can't boast of such a Storr.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elsewhere, O'Mustapha, who was a shoemaker, had to
<span class="nwrp">say:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Business is dreadful bad&mdash;what's to be done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I sold fifty boots, I don't mend one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer Wellingtons are all the go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-lows alone are worn by high and low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain upon my door this bill I fix&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Five thousand Bluchers, all at 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong boys' at 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>"&mdash;folks once would use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now it's quite another pair of shoes.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>A'Beckett, however, did not lay himself out for punning
in and out of season. His chief merit is the neatness of his
style and the pervading nature of his wit.</p>

<p>The most famous of all the Ali Baba travesties was
that "joint-stock" burlesque, "The Forty Thieves,"
written by members of the Savage Club, and performed
by the authors themselves at the Lyceum, in 1860, for the
benefit of the families of two literary men just then deceased.
Planché wrote the prologue for this piece, and it was at
once so brilliant and so admirably delivered by Leicester
Buckingham that it nearly obtained the extraordinary
honour of an encore. It was followed, three years later,
by H. J. Byron's "Ali Baba, or the Thirty-Nine Thieves
(in accordance with the author's habit of taking one off!)."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Abdallah, the captain of the thieves (played by Miss Ada
Swanborough), was here depicted as a rascal of the quiet,
elegant order, in sharp contrast to the Surrey-side villainy
of his lieutenant, Hassarac. A colloquy between these
gave Byron an opportunity of satirising the melodramatic
criminal of the "good old <span class="nwrp">times":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Abdal.</i> From all you say, my friend, you see it's plain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, like King Richard, murder when you smile.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In 1872 Mr. Reece wrote for the Gaiety a piece called
"Ali Baba à la Mode"; in 1880 he prepared for the same
theatre another version called "The Forty Thieves."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This
latter, if I remember rightly, was the first of the burlesques
in three acts. It presented in Mr. Terry (Ali Baba),
Miss Farren (Ganem), Mr. Royce (Hassarac), and Miss
Vaughan (Morgiana), a quartett which is specially well
remembered for the <em>verve</em> and vivacity of its performance.</p>

<p>The fortunes of Prince Camaralzaman have been pictured
on the burlesque stage by the Brothers Brough, by Messrs.
Bellingham and Best, by H. J. Byron, and by Mr.
Burnand.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> "Camaralzaman and Badoura, or the Peri
who loved the Prince," was the Broughs' title, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
had the assistance of Mrs. Keeley, of Keeley (as a Djinn),
of Bland (as the Emperor Bung), of Miss Reynolds (as
Badoura), and of Miss Horton (as the hero). Dimpl Tshin
was the name given to one of the characters, and Skilopht
that of another. The original story was followed in the
main. Camaralzaman declines to marry at his father's request,
and is incarcerated. In that position he <span class="nwrp">soliloquises:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis now the very witching time of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, were I free, would bring with it delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now could I drink hot grog, hear comic songs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or join the gay Casino's gladsome throngs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drain, 'midst buzzing sounds of mirth and chaff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foaming stout, or genial half-and-half;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here a prisoner condemned to stop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can indulge in neither malt nor "hop."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, cruel Pa! to place me in this state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I would avoid your own sad fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear mother, though a model of a wife,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Better be thus than free, and have to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"An eye like Ma's, to threaten and command."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Camaralzaman then breaks out into the following little
bit of vocal <span class="nwrp">parody:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Pope he leads a happy life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he hasn't got a wife;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He knows a trick worth two of that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No shrill abuse his ear affrights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For stopping out too late at nights;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No curtain lectures damp his hopes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy lot must be the Pope's.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Broughs were always ingenious in their word-plays.

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>In the piece by Messrs. Bellingham and Best&mdash;"Prince
Camaralzaman, or the Fairies' Revenge"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>&mdash;we find, amid
many well-conceived and well-executed puns, a rather successful
adaptation of the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy,
possessing the merit of being quite in keeping with the
character of the matrimony-scorning <span class="nwrp">Camaralzaman:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To wed or not to wed&mdash;that is the question<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But rather bear the ills that I have got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than fly to others that I yet know not.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In another passage, the "spiritualistic" craze is satirised
in a so-called <span class="nwrp">"chant":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Abracadabra, mystic word, come down to us from the cosmogony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the spell that binds the spirits beneath Mr. Home's mahogany;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When ghostly fingers are tickling some foolish old fellow's fat dumpy knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the medium floats as easily as a modern bubble company;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis then that the spirits are working&mdash;to asses the men they transmogrify<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By spells that have nothing in common with the generally received orthography.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Two of the burlesques on "Arabian Nights" topics are
from the pen of Francis Talfourd. First came&mdash;in 1852, at
the Olympic&mdash;"Ganem, the Slave of Love" (with Miss
Fanny Maskell as Fetnah, the caliph's favourite); and later&mdash;in
1854, at the St. James's&mdash;"Abon Hassan, or the Hunt
after Happiness" (with Mr. Toole as Haroun-al-Raschid).
In the former piece the wealth of felicitous punning is
remarkable. Thus, in his very, first speech, Ganem, coming
in intoxicated, <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All things around me seem involved in doubt,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I can't go far&mdash;I'm too far gone already.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! could I swarm this lime, I might, <i>sans doute</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn from its friendly branch my proper route.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In other places we <span class="nwrp">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>"Abon Hassan" is less freely endowed with verbal
pleasantry, but it has its fair share of puns, and the songs
are numerous and bright. At the close, the hero, addressing
the audience, allows himself to drop into the
reflective <span class="nwrp">mood:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>On German faërie our comic dramatists have not drawn
at all largely. Such pieces as Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett's
"Knight and the Sprite, or the Cold-Water Cure," with
Ondine as its heroine; H. J. Byron's "Nymph of the
Lurleyburg, or the Knight and the Naiads," based on
the Lurline legend; and Mr. Burnand's "Rumpelstiltskin,
or the Woman at the Wheel," founded on one of the
Brothers Grimm's narratives, are exceptional incursions
in this field. The first was seen at the Strand in 1884,
with Mrs. Walter Lacy as Sir Hildebrand, and with Hall
and Romer in other parts. "The Nymph of the Lurleyburg"
has often done duty for the purposes of Christmas
extravaganza. When it was first performed&mdash;in 1859&mdash;Miss
Woolgar was the Sir Rupert the Reckless, Mr.
Toole the Seneschal, and Paul Bedford the Baron Witz, the
<i>locale</i> being the Adelphi. Mr. Burnand introduced into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
"Rumpelstiltskin" (Royalty, 1864) a few modifications of
the German tale, inventing and importing new characters.
In one of the scenes he furnished a diverting suggestion
of the situation in "The Ticket of Leave Man," when
there comes the sudden and effective revelation of "Hawkshaw
the Detective!" Among the <i lang="la">personæ</i> are King
Tagarag the Tremendous, Prince Poppet, Baron Higgle-de-Piggle,
Wriggleletto (the court spy), Jolinosio (a miller),
and Fraulein Splitaharter (the belle of the village). Miss
Ada Cavendish was the Princess Superba.</p>

<p>"The Vampire"&mdash;a burlesque by Mr. Reece, which was
played at the Strand in 1872&mdash;appears to have owed its
origin about equally to the German legend, the romance
which Lord Byron wrote on the subject, and the play which
Dion Boucicault founded on the topic in 1852. As, however,
the legend was the inspiration alike of romance, play,
and travestie, the travestie may be mentioned here. Mr.
Reece had drawn the Vampire as a being so fond of "blood,"
that he sought to possess it in the shape of the notebooks
of two "sensation"-novelists, one of whom, Lady Audley
Moonstone, was admirably represented by Mrs. Raymond.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The following specimen of the dialogue has been handed

<p>In the realm of Spanish legend there have been still
fewer explorers. Albert Smith took one of Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Irving's tales of the Alhambra, and fashioned it into
"The Alhambra, or The Beautiful Princess," played at
the Princess's in 1851, with the Keeleys, Wigan, Harley,
Flexmore, and Miss Vivash. H. J. Byron afterwards
went to the same source for "The Pilgrim of Love," in the
first cast of which&mdash;at the Haymarket in 1860&mdash;we find the
names of Mrs. Buckingham White as the Pilgrim, Chippendale
as his tutor, Compton as the King of Toledo, Rogers
as the King of Granada, and C. Coghlan as Mafoi, a Frenchman:
a rather notable collocation of distinguished players.</p>

<p>The Fables of Æsop have inspired at least one travestie&mdash;"Leo
the Terrible," by Stirling Coyne and Francis
Talfourd. In this piece (brought out at the Haymarket
in 1852) all the characters but four wore the heads of
beasts or birds&mdash;a lion (Bland), a wolf (Buckstone), a fox,
an owl, a ram, a poodle, a cat (Miss Maskell), and so
on. The four exceptions were Sir Norval de Battersea,
Timoleon Sindbad Potts (Keeley), Æsop, and Gay; and
the play opened with a <i>rencontre</i> between the two last-named
worthies. Æsop began with a vocal parody on
"The Light of other <span class="nwrp">Days":&mdash;</span></p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V">V.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BURLESQUE OF HISTORY.</p>


<p>In this department the artists in travestie have not done
so much as might have been expected. Even when
we include in the word "history" such things as myths,
legends, and traditions, we find that the historical, in
comparison with the other fields open to the parodists,
has been quite "second favourite." Particularly little has
been achieved in the burlesque of foreign persons and
events; and, in the case of our own celebrities, the only
really familiar figure on the comic stage has been that
of "Bluff King Hal." King Arthur, Alfred the Great,
Elizabeth, Oliver Cromwell, have made rare appearances
in motley. In the by-paths of history, general and local,
the burlesque writers have devoted themselves most frequently
to popular personages like Herne the Hunter, the
Lady Godiva, Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Guy Fawkes,
Claude Duval, and Richard Turpin.</p>

<p>The story of Rome has supplied subjects for two of
the most notable burlesques of the past twenty years&mdash;the
"Romulus and Remus" of Mr. Reece, and the "Field
Marshal Julius Cnæsar" of Mr. Burnand. The former was
played at the Vaudeville in 1872, and had for its chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
interpreters Messrs. James and Thorne, who had not yet
wholly surrendered burlesque for comedy. Mr. James was
Romulus, and Mr. Thorne was Remus; and they came
on in the first scene as children, dressed in pinafores and
socks, and carrying toys. The pair begin by quarrelling as
to which of them was born first. Remus rests his claim
on his superior <span class="nwrp">size:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nature, perceiving "true grit" and "no shoddy,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made me thus "double stout" with "extra body."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which Romulus <span class="nwrp">replies:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though at our birth (when both kicked up a shine)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cry was <em>stout</em>, mine was the <em>elder whine</em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence this thin body, wise folks say who've been here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We're sure you are the <em>elder</em>, now we've <em>seen yer</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the two grow up (as they do between the first
scene and the second), the question is, which is to be
King of Rome&mdash;a question decided eventually by personal
combat, in which Remus falls. Ultimately the pair decide
to be partners in the throne&mdash;an obvious allusion to the
position held by the two actors in reference to the Vaudeville
Theatre.</p>

<p>The date of the production of "Romulus and Remus"
(1872) could be fixed by the aid of a brief passage introduced
in travestie of a scene between Cromwell and the
King in Mr. Wills's "Charles I.," then "running" at the
Lyceum. Early in the piece we have these <span class="nwrp">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Remus.</i> The public will have (though to me it's pills)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The classic drama. Well, they have their <i>Wills</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Apollo.</i> One manager this line keeps without swerving&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Baccharia.</i> And he succeeds!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Romulus.</i><span class="indent6"> But not without des-<em>erving</em>.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>Later, Remus says to <span class="nwrp">Romulus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I can't express to you the pain I suffer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In saying it; but, brother, you're a duffer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the happy man! Pride has a tumble!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hopes of reigning, sir, are <em>all of a crumble</em>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rom.</i> You dare to scoff at me, rebellious thing! (<i class="stage-direction">knocks his hat off</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncover in the presence of your king!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">To audience</i>) That's historical!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rem.</i><span class="indent9">What! strike me, dare you?</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">Quietly</i>) Give me an earldom, and perhaps I'll spare you!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rom.</i> Your base insinuation I resent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I go in for king and parliament.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rem.</i> Your parliament's all gingerbread! (How nice!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a patriot and will have my price.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rom.</i> Defied! (<i class="stage-direction">blows trumpet</i>). What, ho! my faithful guards, where be 'em?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">Enter, from various entrances, all the characters, and</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i class="stage-direction">supers. Tableau as in "Charles I."</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">To audience</i>) I say! They can't beat <em>that</em> at the Lyceum.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this piece Apollo (Miss Nelly Power) figures as a sort
of Chorus, commenting on the action and interposing in it;
while Baccharia (Miss Maria Rhodes) is represented as the
sister of Tatius and a husband-huntress. The burlesque
has all Mr. Reece's ingenuity in <i>jeu-de-mot</i> work. For
<span class="nwrp">instance:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tatius.</i> This is too much!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Baccharia.</i><span class="indent6">To boast of deeds audacious.</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tatius.</i> Too callous!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Romulus.</i><span class="indent3"><em>Calais!</em> Don't be <em>Ostend-Tatius!</em></span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Burnand's "Julius Cnæsar" made the walls of the
Royalty resound with laughter in the autumn of 1870. In
the spring of 1869 William Brough had brought out at the
Strand his version of the tale of Joan of Arc, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
represented as the leader of a troop of Amazons, extremely
interested in Woman's Rights. She comes, as in history,
to the French king's assistance; but, falling in love with
a young English soldier, is captured by the invaders and
condemned to resume female attire,&mdash;a sentence which in
the end she manages to evade. A leading part is played
by the Duke of Burgundy, who is for ever uncertain on
which side he shall fight, and whose name provides frequent
opportunity for punning. <span class="nwrp">Thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dunois.</i> See, Burgundy comes!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i><span class="indent8">Is he indeed with me?</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a rule Burgundy ne'er yet agreed with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says he is my friend!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Duchatel.</i><span class="indent3">Well, that's a thumper!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of Burgundy suggests a bumper!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>La Hire.</i> He comes!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King</i> (<i class="stage-direction">looking off</i>). With what a swagger, too! It's clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burgundy doesn't think himself small beer!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lionel.</i> Then, my lord, Burgundy, with all his train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will join our ranks.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Talbot.</i><span class="indent2">My plans are changed again!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll lick the foe in no time&mdash;if not quicker!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burgundy's such a very potent <em>licker</em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strengthened by him, war's hardest blows we'll mock&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a strong Burgundy, despise a kn<em>ock</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, too, is a clever bit of <span class="nwrp">word-play:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Burgundy.</i> The <em>proffer'd table</em> I must needs refuse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My time I can more <em>profitably</em> use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't <em>dine nicely</em> while with projects vasty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mind is filled for changing the <em>dy-nasty</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On this occasion Joan was impersonated by Mr. Thomas
Thorne, Mr. David James being the Duke of Burgundy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Miss Eleanor Button the King, Miss Bella Goodall the
Dunois, and Miss Amy Sheridan the Lionel. In the
present year Joan of Arc has again become the subject of
"respectful perversion,"&mdash;this time by Messrs. J. L. Shine
and "Adrian Ross," and after a fashion to which I shall draw
attention in my final chapter.</p>

<p>Of foreign notabilities, the only other subject of burlesque
worth mentioning is Christopher Columbus, who gave the
title to, and was the principal character in, a piece written
by Mr. Alfred Thompson, and performed at the Gaiety
two-and-thirty years ago. He was also the hero of a
travestie by John Brougham, played in America.</p>

<p>The first English personage in burlesque, in point of
historical order, is the legendary King Arthur, who was the
chief figure in an "extravaganza" produced at the Haymarket
in 1863.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Of this the author was William Brough,
who owed considerably more to Malory than to Tennyson.
There was a scene in which, as in the "Idylls," Vivien
makes Merlin the victim of his own spell; but otherwise
the laureate's withers were unwrung. Arthur (Miss Louise
Keeley) becomes King of Britain by virtue of his power
to draw the magic sword from the stone in which it is
embedded. He is looking forward to wed Guinevere (Miss
Wright), when suddenly she is captured by Cheldric, the
Saxon invader, from whom, however, she is successfully
re-captured by the aid of Vivien (Miss Romer) as the
wielder of Merlin's wand. Sir Launcelot (Miss Lindley) is
exhibited less as the lover of Guinevere than as a warrior;
another prominent knight is the cowardly Sir Key, represented
by Compton. Of direct parody, as I have said, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
piece has little; of punning, as usual, it is all compact.
Vivien says to <span class="nwrp">Merlin:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Teach me your art. In magic I'd excel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In studies deep I'd plunge, a <em>diving belle</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now for my lesson. It's a curious thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knowledge is <em>increased</em> by <em>lessoning</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Arthur says to <span class="nwrp">Guinevere:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Fortune us has made alike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've acted like a <em>spoon</em>&mdash;while you act <em>ladle</em>-like!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Also, when he has lost his <span class="nwrp"><em>ladle</em>-love:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My Guinevere made prisoner, Merlin too!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both I've to rue, if 'tis indeed <em>ter-rue</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cope with all these horrors can I hope?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What evil stars affect my horrors-cope!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one can I, the slightest aid to lend, see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm in a frenzy since I can no <em>friend see</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wits, unstrung, hang loose my head inside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should be Christmas feels like <em>wits-untied</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Guinevere, on her part, is equally afflicted with the
punning mania. While immured in Cheldric's castle, she
<span class="nwrp">soliloquises:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall I endure this state of things unjust?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, Arthur's destined spouse? I <em>spouse</em> I must.<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>In Australia, twenty-three years ago, there was produced
a burlesque called "King Arthur, or Launcelot the Loose,
Gin-ever the Square, and the Knights of the Round Table,
and other Furniture"; the perpetrator's name was W. M.
Akhurst. Of recent years, the only prominent travestie of
the subject has been that produced in 1889, by Messrs.
Richard Butler and Henry Chance Newton ("Richard-Henry"),
who entitled their work "Launcelot the Lovely,
or the Idol of the King." Here, again, Tennyson and
Malory were both very loyally and lightly treated, and,
though Mr. Arthur Roberts as Launcelot was eminently
funny, the prepossessions of the audience were in no way
shocked.</p>

<p>The romantic tale of the loves of Fair Rosamond and
His Majesty Henry II. has naturally attracted the notice
of the travestie writers. In one instance, I regret to
record, it fared very ill at the hands of the "dramatist."
One T. P. Taylor brought out at Sadler's Wells in the
'thirties a one-act piece which he called "Fair Rosamond
according to the History of England," in which the story
was at once modernised and degraded. Henry became a
Mr. Henry King&mdash;"a ruler, having been a stationer";
the Queen necessarily figured as "Mrs. Ellinor King."
Rosamond herself was transmogrified into "a black girl,
fair yet faulty," talking in "darkey" patois, and furnished
with a father, black like herself, who combined the profession
of fiddler and boot-black. The piece appears to
have been successful in its day, but, to read, it is both
vulgar and without a spark of wit.</p>

<p>Happily, the subject was taken up in our own time by
Mr. Burnand, whose "Fair Rosamond, or the Maze, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Maid, and the Monarch," seen at the Olympic in 1862,
is among the most vivacious of his productions.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Here
the writer boldly breaks away from historical tradition.
He makes Henry in love with Rosamond, it is true; but
Rosamond (Miss Hughes), on her side, has given her
heart to Sir Pierre de Bonbon (Horace Wigan)&mdash;a Frenchman,
as his name betokens. As Rosamond sings in the
<span class="nwrp"><i>finale</i>:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hist'ry says that Rosamond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Hen-e-ry was fond;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus my character was wronged,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By a base aspersion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To old stories don't <em>you</em> trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered up with ages' dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the truth henceforth you must<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take our Wych Street version.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rosamond, therefore, being innocent, it stands to reason
that it would not be fair to poison her, as in the story;
and so the Queen (played originally by Robson) is made to
excuse her clemency in not forcing the girl to accept the
"cup" she offers <span class="nwrp">her:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why's Rosamond not killed at all? You see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She isn't poisoned as she ought to be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because, in deference to modern ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No poisoned heroines can end our plays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, the brimming cup she held this minute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the objection, friends, has nothing in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll say, with history we freedom use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, don't historians write to suit their views?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We answer to the critical consistory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we have made <em>our</em> views to suit our history.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the most amusing scenes in the burlesque is
that in which Ellinor meets Henry for the first time after
hearing of his <span class="nwrp">infidelity:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Following the stream of time, we arrive next at a
travestie of the insurrection, in the reign of Richard II., in
which Wat Tyler was the prime mover. Tyler deserves
celebration in the history of burlesque as the hero of the
only work of this kind produced by Mr. George Augustus
Sala. This well-known <i>littérateur</i> came out as a writer of
travestie at the Gaiety in 1869, but has not been tempted
to repeat the achievement. The fact is to be regretted, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
his "Wat Tyler, M.P." had many strokes of wit and satire.
Wat, being named Tyler, naturally became, in a piece
of this <i>genre</i>, a hatter. He is portrayed as aspiring to
Parliament, succeeding in his candidature, resisting payment
of a tax upon chignons, heading a revolt against the
powers that were, penetrating triumphantly into the royal
palace, there getting drunk, and being, in the end, overpowered
by the forces of the King. In his address to the
electors from the hustings, there is a pleasant amalgam
of pun and sarcasm. Tyler (who was impersonated by
Mr. Toole) begins by <span class="nwrp">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Jane Shore has been the heroine of a burlesque written
by Mr. Wilton Jones, and brought out in the provinces
eleven years ago. Messrs. "Richard Henry" have also
composed a travestie of her story, as handed down by
chroniclers. In Mr. Jones's piece reliance was placed,
as of old, upon humorous situation and ear-splitting pun.
I give an example of both qualities. Jane has denounced
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as the murderer of the
Princes in the Tower, and he now proclaims her <span class="nwrp">doom:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In three well-known travesties, Henry VIII. plays the
most conspicuous part&mdash;in William Brough's "Field of the
Cloth of Gold" (1868, Strand), in Mr. Burnand's "Windsor
Castle" (Strand, 1865), and Mr. Conway Edwardes' "Anne
Boleyn" (Royalty, 1872). I name these in the order in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
which they deal with historical events. In "The Field of
the Cloth of Gold" Katherine of Arragon is Queen, with
Anne Boleyn (Miss F. Hughes) as maid of honour and
(as Her Majesty suspects) a rival. To this suspicion Anne
makes reference in the following <span class="nwrp">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Queen Katherine! her I'm quite afraid of;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She vows it isn't <em>honour</em> that I'm <em>maid</em> of;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declares King Henry loves me&mdash;as for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am no better than I ought to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such language she employs, I'm grieved to state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen <em>Kate</em> gets daily more <em>in-daily-Kate</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I remonstrate, or to her appeal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Katherine goes off like a Katherine wheel.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "Windsor Castle" the King is in love, more or less,
with Anne (Mr. Thomas Thorne), but inclined to let his
vagrant fancy wander after Mabel Lynwood (Miss Ada
Swanborough), who turns out to be Anne's sister. Anne, it
is recorded, sang like a siren, and was especially addicted
to a few French ditties. Of these Mr. Burnand makes her
sing a diverting parody, printed, in "the book of the play,"
in French "as she is pronounced." The song is called</p>

<p>In "Anne Boleyn," again, Anne (E. Danvers) is at
last Queen, but with her life embittered by King Henry's
flirtations with Jane Seymour (Miss Harriet Coveney). Thus,
in one place, Anne <span class="nwrp">exclaims:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i0">She would ke-rush me!&mdash;ah! But soft&mdash;no riot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, bubbling heart, oblige me, and lie quiet.<br /></span>

<p>"The Field of the Cloth of Gold" (which was revived
in London, with only tolerable success, a year or two ago)
has to do mainly with the meeting of Henry VIII. and
Francis I. (Mr. David James) on that historic spot&mdash;an
event which is here surrounded with the most ludicrous
circumstances possible. There is a sub-plot which deals
with the loves of Constance de Grey (Miss A. Swanborough)
and the Earl of Darnley (Miss Lydia Thompson), as interrupted
and jeopardised by the pretensions and machinations
of Sir Guy the Cripple (Mr. Thomas Thorne). The
comic incidents are somewhat pantomimical, and the main
merit of the piece lies in the humour of its dialogue, which
is always sparkling. One of the puns in this burlesque is
among the very best ever perpetrated, and is, indeed, a
historical possession. Need I quote it? The King has
crossed over from Dover to Calais on a stormy day, and
arrives in a very "indisposed" <span class="nwrp">condition:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Good Queen Bess was added to Mr. Burnand's gallery
in 1870, when his "E-liz-a-beth, or the Don, the Duck,
the Drake, and the Invisible Armada," was brought out at
the Vaudeville, with Mr. Thorne as the Queen, Mr. David
James as Whiskerandos, and George Honey as Drake.
The "Maiden Queen" has not been greatly tantalised by
the burlesque writers, who, on the other hand, have made
very free with a gentleman who much disturbed her successor&mdash;Guy
Fawkes. Mr. Burnand handled him in 1866
(at the Strand); H. J. Byron followed suit at the Gaiety in
1874; last year we had the "Guy Fawkes, Esq." of Messrs.
"A. C. Torr" (Fred Leslie) and H. F. Clark; and I believe
that Mr. Wilton Jones, too, has written a travestie on the
subject. Charles II. was burlesqued by Mr. Gilbert Arthur
a'Beckett in 1872, the <i>locale</i> being the Court Theatre,
and the full title of the piece "Charles II., or Something
like History." In this, as in Mr. Reece's "Romulus
and Remus," there was some parody of the Lyceum
"Charles I."&mdash;Mr. Righton, as Cromwell, imitating both
Mr. Irving and George Belmore, besides indulging in the
cancan! W. J. Hill was the King, and Mme. Cornèlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
D'Anka the Queen (Catherine of Braganza). Pepys,
Rochester, and Lily the Astrologer also figured in the
piece. Cromwell was afterwards the leading personage in
the "Oliver Grumble" of Mr. George Dance (Novelty,
1886).</p>

<p>About the names of such heroes and heroines as the Lady
Godiva, Dick Whittington, Robin Hood, Herne the Hunter,
and those distinguished footpads Claude Duval and Dick
Turpin, there hangs a good deal that is clearly mythical.
Still, some myths have more real vitality than absolute
fact; and who does not believe firmly that the Lady Godiva
rode round Coventry "clothed on" with nothing but her
chastity, and, by taking away a grinding tax, "built herself
an everlasting name"? Her adventure has been burlesqued
at least twice&mdash;once by Francis Talfourd and a collaborator,
at another time by Mr. H. Chance Newton. The Talfourd
piece was called "Godiva, or Y<sup>e</sup> Ladye of Coventrie and
Y<sup>e</sup> Exyle Fayrie" and produced at the Strand in 1851.
Mr. Newton christened his work "Giddy Godiva." In the
earlier burlesque, "y<sup>e</sup> exyle fayrie" Ignota (Miss Romer)
is introduced merely as a <i lang="la">dea ex machinâ</i> in the interests
of the heroine (Miss Marshall), who, in a passage of Shakespearean
reminiscence, discusses the undertaking to which
she has been incited by her <span class="nwrp">husband:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Three burlesques have been devoted to the life and
adventures of Sir Richard Whittington. There was, first,
the "Whittington Junior, and his Sensation Cat," of Mr.
Reece (Royalty, 1870); next, the "Young Dick Whittington"
of Mr. Wilton Jones (Leicester, 1881); and next, the
"Whittington and his Cat" of Mr. Burnand (Gaiety, 1881).
Mr. Reece had Miss Henrietta Hodson (Mrs. Labouchere)
for his Whittington, while Miss Farren was Mr. Burnand's.
Robin Hood has had at least as many burlesque biographies
as Whittington. A travestie, written by Stocqueler, Shirley
Brooks, and Charles Kenny, and produced at the Lyceum
in 1846, with the Keeleys, Wigan and Frank Matthews, was
followed in 1862, at the Olympic, by one from the pen of
Mr. Burnand. Mr. Reece wrote one, called "Little Robin
Hood," which was seen at the Royalty in 1871, and this
was revived&mdash;in three-act form&mdash;at the Gaiety in 1882,
with Mr. Arthur Williams as a particularly droll Richard I.
Robin Hood, it may also be noted, was a prominent
character in Mr. Burnand's "Hit or 'Miss,'" at the Olympic
in 1868. Herne the Hunter (who has a place in Mr.
Burnand's "Windsor Castle") was made the leading personage
in, and gave the title to, a travestie composed by
Messrs. Reece and Yardley, and performed at the Gaiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in 1881. Five years later, at the Folly, we had "Herne
the Hunted," in which Mr. H. P. Stephens had a hand,
as well as Messrs. Yardley and Reece. Claude Duval was
turned into a burlesque hero by Mr. Burnand, and strutted
his hour upon the stage at the Royalty in 1869; followed
<i>longo intervallo</i> by Turpin&mdash;here called "Dandy Dick
Turpin, the Mashing Highwayman,"&mdash;whom Mr. Geoffrey
Thorn (Charles Townley) made the chief personage of a
travestie performed in London in 1889.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BURLESQUE OF SHAKESPEARE.</p>


<p>Travestie of the drama and things dramatic has
naturally played a large part in the history of
English stage burlesque. Side by side with the producers
and interpreters of tragedy, melodrama, and plays of sentiment,
have been the possessors of the humorous spirit, who&mdash;whether
as writers or as actors&mdash;have been quick to
see the points in which works of serious plan and treatment
have been open to the shafts of ridicule and raillery.
As we have seen, most of the earliest efforts in English
stage burlesque were directed against the extravagant
tragedies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
As time went on, and the limits of the serious drama
became more extended, so did the limits of burlesque
expand, and, from the days of John Poole downwards, the
large variety of serious dramatic production has co-existed
with a corresponding variety in the subject and style of
the travesties submitted to the public.</p>

<p>Among those travesties a prominent place has been taken
by the pieces devoted to the burlesque of Shakespeare&mdash;not
because they have been particularly numerous, for
they have not been so&mdash;nor because they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
uniformly successful, for the earlier specimens were singularly
weak&mdash;but because of the general daring of the
attempts, and because also of the genuine sense of
fun exhibited by such baiters of "the Bard" as Gilbert
a'Beckett, Francis Talfourd, Stirling Coyne, William
Brough, Andrew Halliday (Duff), F. C. Burnand, H. J.
Byron, and W. S. Gilbert. The business of burlesquing
Shakespeare has never, so far as I can see, been taken
up in a wholesale or an intentionally irreverent spirit.
The seventeenth and eighteenth-century satirists left "the
Bard" severely alone, and it was not until 1810 that the
first formal travestie of Shakespeare&mdash;Poole's "Hamlet
Travestie"&mdash;saw the light.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The author then made all
due apology for his temerity, at the same time pointing
out the absurdity of the idea that any amount or kind of
burlesque could possibly sully the fame of the dramatist.
Two years later, in the course of his preface to the fourth
edition of his work, Poole ironically congratulated "those
who, on its first appearance, were apprehensive for the
reputation of Shakespeare," upon the fact "that, notwithstanding
Three Editions already before the public, he is
neither expelled from our libraries, nor banished from our
stage."</p>

<p>The truth is, a brilliant burlesque does harm to nobody;
and a bad burlesque does but recoil upon the head of its
author and his exponents. Poole's "Hamlet Travestie" is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
marked by the best intentions, but, as a whole, it makes
dreary reading. The opening colloquy between Hamlet,
King Claudius, and Queen Gertrude will give, to those
who have not already perused the piece, a notion of the
quality of the <span class="nwrp">dialogue:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It was part of Poole's method to put the soliloquies
into the form of songs, and so we find the lines beginning
"O that this too too solid flesh would melt!" appearing in
the following <span class="nwrp">form:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The "annotations" appended to the text of the burlesque
are in parody of the performances of the commentators,
who at least are fair game for chaff of this sort, and on
whom Poole, in his preface, lavishes some excellent indignation.</p>

<p>Of subsequent burlesques of "Hamlet" there have not
been many, but some of them have been really clever and
commendable. There was, for instance, Talfourd's, published
at Oxford in 1849; there was the "Hamlet à la
Mode" of Messrs. G. L. Gordon and G. W. Anson,
performed at Liverpool in 1877; there was the "Very
Little Hamlet" of Mr. William Yardley, seen at the Gaiety
in 1884; and last, but assuredly not least, we have had the
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern" of Mr. Gilbert, which,
written originally without thought either of public or of
private representation, has been enacted at a benefit
<i>matinée</i> during the present year.</p>

<p>In "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern," which is an unpretentious
little "skit," covering only some sixteen or
seventeen printed pages, Mr. Gilbert supposes that Hamlet
is the son (not the step-son) of Claudius. "Rosencrantz is
a lover of Ophelia, to whom Hamlet is betrothed, and they
lay their heads together to devise a plan by which Hamlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
may be put out of the way. Some Court theatricals are in
preparation." Now, once upon a time, Claudius had written
a tragedy, which was damned, and to which no one is
allowed to make reference on pain of death. "Ophelia
and Rosencrantz persuade Hamlet to play his father's
tragedy before the king and court. Hamlet, who is unaware
of the proscription, does so; and he is banished, and
Rosencrantz happily united to Ophelia."</p>

<p>In the first act, Rosencrantz, who has never seen Hamlet
(apparently, because the former has been abroad), asks
Ophelia what the Prince is like, and that gives Mr. Gilbert
an opportunity for some characteristic satire. Ophelia says
of Hamlet that he is "alike for no two seasons at a <span class="nwrp">time":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes he's tall&mdash;sometimes he's very short&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Opinion is divided. Some men hold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some that he's really mad, but shamming sane&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some that he will be mad, some that he <em>was</em>&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(As far as I can make out what they mean),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The favourite theory's somewhat like this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hamlet is idiotically sane<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>In the second act, the Queen, observing that Hamlet
is about to soliloquise, urges Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
to "prevent this, gentlemen, by any <span class="nwrp">means":&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The third act opens with a passage in which the turns
and rhythm of Shakespearean prose are happily <span class="nwrp">imitated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i class="stage-direction">Enter</i> King <i>and</i> Queen, <i>meeting</i> Rosencrantz.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Queen.</i> A fair good morrow to you, Rosencrantz. How march the
Royal revels?</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Lamely, madam, lamely, like a one-legged duck. The Prince
has discovered a strange play. He hath called it "A Right Reckoning
Long Delayed."</p>

<p><i>Claud.</i> And of what fashion is the Prince's play?</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> 'Tis an excellent poor tragedy, my Lord&mdash;a thing of shreds and
patches welded into a form that hath mass without consistency, like an
ill-built villa.</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i> But, sir, you should have used your best endeavours to wean
his phantasy from such a play.</p>

<p><i>Ros.</i> Madam, I did, and with some success; for he now seeth the
absurdity of its tragical catastrophes, and laughs at it as freely as we
do. So, albeit the poor author had hoped to have drawn tears of
sympathy, the Prince hath resolved to present it as a piece of pompous
folly intended to excite no loftier emotion than laughter and surprise.</p></blockquote>

<p>After Poole published his "Hamlet,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Shakespearean
burlesque slumbered until 1834, when Maurice G. Dowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
produced at Liverpool his "Othello Travestie." In this
dull production, the Moor of Venice figures as "an independent
nigger from the Republic of Hayti," and talks
in "darkey" dialect (as does the same writer's Clifford in
"Fair Rosamond"). Here, for example, is this Othello's
address to the Senate (written and sung to the air of
"Yankee <span class="nwrp">Doodle"):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>W. J. Hammond played Othello in this piece, both at
Liverpool, and afterwards at the Strand Theatre, where
popular Miss E. Daly was the Desdemona and H. Hall
the Iago. What can these presumably capable actors have
thought of their <i>rôles</i>? The text of the burlesque is almost
wholly without humour, of which, however, there is a gleam
in the complaint made by Cassio that he has been ruined
by a pint of <span class="nwrp">beer:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>H. J. Byron's "Rival Othellos" (played at the Strand
in 1876) was not a travestie of the tragedy; but it
gave opportunity for some clever burlesque of tragic
acting.</p>

<p>We come now to the first (and, so far as I know, the only)
travestie of "King John," which happily was essayed by the
capable pen of Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett. The year was
1837, the <i>locale</i> the St. James's Theatre, and Hall the
representative of the title-part, with Mme. Sala as Lady
Constance. The play was lucky in being dealt with by so
deft a workman. The subject was not very promising, and
all was done with it that was possible. The scene in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the King incites Hubert to get rid of Arthur was thus
<span class="nwrp">travestied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The first burlesque of "Romeo and Juliet" was brought
out at the Strand in the same year as that which saw
the birth of A'Beckett's "King John." The author was
Maurice G. Dowling, who succeeded in producing something
worthy to rank with his "Othello." In his "Romeo
and Juliet" Montagu and Capulet are rival basket-makers,
"Mr." Mercutio being foreman to the former, who also has
"Mr. Ben Volio" in his employ. Tybalt is a fireman and
ratcatcher to the Duke of Mantua; "Mr." Friar Laurence,
a "black-and-white-smith" at Gretna Green. Romeo talks
in illiterate fashion, and at one point sticks a pin into Paris's
back! Miss Daly was the Juliet, and she and Hammond
(as Romeo) had to speak, in the balcony scene, such lines
as <span class="nwrp">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>For the rest, the burlesque followed many lines of the
original closely enough,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> save that, at the end, Romeo,
Juliet, Mercutio, Tybalt, and Paris, were all revived,
much to the indignation of Shakespeare, a statue of whom
appeared, with finger held up in a menacing manner.</p>

<p>The piece was well stocked with puns; as, for <span class="nwrp">example:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who doubts Mercutio's courage him mistakes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hates a <em>broil</em>, but he will fight for <em>stakes</em>.<br /></span>

<p>After "Romeo and Juliet," the first of Shakespeare's
plays to be burlesqued was "Richard III.," of which
Charles Selby, the comedian, and Stirling Coyne, the well-known
man of letters, each perpetrated a travestie in 1844.
Selby's piece<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was founded on the Colley Cibber adaptation,
and introduced Henry VI., who, at the end, was represented
as coming to life again and quietly assuming the crown
which Richmond was about to take. Richard also is
resuscitated, after a fashion very popular in burlesques
of Shakespeare. Of literary merit Selby's work had little.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty-four years later, Mr. Burnand took up this
subject. His work was called "The Rise and Fall of
Richard III.," and was performed at the Royalty. His
treatment of the wooing scene may well be contrasted
with that of Selby. For <span class="nwrp">instance:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Richard.</i> I see that you a passion for me foster&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Rich.</i> A friend in-knee'd, ma'am, is a friend indeed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In puns, and good puns too, this piece is particularly
prolific. Thus, Richard's mother says of him that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He as a child took early to the bottle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all our family did, and my relations&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>Of Richmond, the Duchess of York <span class="nwrp">observes:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i0"><i>Richard.</i> Tis a French crop, like grass&mdash;'tis <em>à la mowed</em>.<br /></span>

<p>Richmond, by the way, is supposed to be fresh from
France, and talks broken English. The Duchess aforesaid
asks <span class="nwrp">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How are you, Richmond? well? or <em>Richmond 'ill</em>?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Especially the <em>Mace</em>&mdash;he does look <em>spicey</em>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But perhaps the best pun in the piece is that which is
made apropos of the fact that Catesby and Tyrell have
fallen over the coal-scuttle on the stairs and hurt <span class="nwrp">themselves:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Richard.</i> My friends are hurt, so you'll excuse them grinning.<br /></span>

<p>Talfourd's "Macbeth, somewhat removed from the Text
of Shakespeare," was first performed in 1847 at Henley-on-Thames
during the regatta; next, at the Strand, in 1848;
afterwards at the Olympic, in 1853. At the last-named
theatre it had the advantage of the aid of Robson in the
title-part, of G. Cooke as Duncan, and of Mrs. A. Phillips as
Lady Macbeth. It paraphrases the original fairly well until
near the close, when, after Macduff has slain Macbeth,
Duncan reappears (like Henry VI. in Selby's piece) and
takes the crown from Malcolm. Similarly, Macbeth, his wife,
and Banquo turn up again, and announce their willingness
to die nightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first act Lady Macbeth comes in reading her
husband's letter, as <span class="nwrp">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We met, 'twas on a heath, and on that day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sally, report has said, and I have got<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They called me, dear, all manner of rum things:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For it's affecting.&mdash;Sally, dear, good-bye!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20"><span class="smcap">Samuel Macbeth.</span><br /></span>

<p>Lady Macbeth comments on <span class="nwrp">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of all rum goes, this is about the rummest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cawdor thou art, and shalt be&mdash;what thou'rt promised.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That has the <em>will</em> to sin, but not the <em>pluck</em>.<br /></span>

<p>When Macbeth enters, she <span class="nwrp">cries:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Welcome, great Glamis!&mdash;welcome, worthy Cawdor!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If I do this, no <em>rest</em> for me&mdash;you'll get it all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then they sing a duet, to the tune of "There's a good
time <span class="nwrp">coming":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lady M.</i> There's a good chance coming, Sam&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>The first burlesque of "The Tempest" made its appearance
at the Adelphi in 1848. It was from the pen of the
Brothers Brough, and was entitled "The Enchanted Isle,
or Raising the Wind on the most Approved Principles."
"O." Smith was Prospero, with Miss Taylor as his daughter
Miranda; Miss Woolgar being the Ferdinand, with Paul
Bedford for her father&mdash;the Ariel Mme. Celeste, and the
Caliban Munyard. Some years were destined to elapse
before the subject again attracted the burlesque writer; and
the writer then was Mr. Burnand, who gave to his work the
name of "Ariel," submitting it to the public in 1883 at
the Gaiety. Miss Ellen Farren took the title-part, with
Mr. Henry Monkhouse as Prospero, Mr. Frank Wyatt
as Sebastian, Mr. Dallas as Alonso, and Miss Connie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Gilchrist as Miranda. This "perversion" was in three
acts, and was one of the productions which led the way to
the New Burlesque.</p>

<p>To Talfourd belongs the distinction of being the first
to burlesque "The Merchant of Venice." He called his
work "Shylock, or the Merchant of Venice Preserved:
an entirely New Reading of Shakespeare, from an edition
hitherto undiscovered by modern authorities, and which it
is hoped may be received as the stray leaves of a Jerusalem
Hearty-Joke." This came out at the Olympic in 1853, and
again Talfourd had Robson as the exponent of his principal
character. Again, too, he followed his original with some
care, burlesquing rather in detail than on broad lines.
Take, for example, his "reading" of a portion of the trial
scene. Shylock has been foiled by Portia, and wishes to
leave the <span class="nwrp">court:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Gratiano, in this version, is represented as a flunkey, in
which character he makes love to <span class="nwrp">Nerissa:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Mr. Burnand has written two burlesques on "Antony
and Cleopatra"&mdash;one brought out under that title at the
Haymarket in 1866; the other produced at the Gaiety
in 1873, under the name of "Our Own Antony and
Cleopatra." A third travestie of the tragedy, called
"Mdlle. Cleopatra," and written by Mr. W. Sapte, junior,
was seen at the Avenue in the present year.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BURLESQUE OF MODERN DRAMA.</p>


<p>We now pass to a department of burlesque writing
larger in extent and greater in variety than any
other&mdash;that in which the finger of ridicule has been pointed
at poetic and melodramatic plays (other than those of
Shakespeare). This department is far-reaching in the matter
of time. It goes back, for subject, so far as Lee's high-sounding
"Alexander the Great" (better known, perhaps, as
"The Rival Queens"), which, first produced in 1678, was
travestied by Dibdin, in "Alexander the Great in Little," a
"grand tragi-comic operatic burlesque spectacle," originally
seen at the Strand in 1837, with Hammond as Alexander
and Mrs. Stirling as Roxana. Seven years later there was
performed at the Surrey a burlesque, by Montagu Corri, of
Lillo's famous tragedy "George Barnwell" (1730), here
called "Georgy Barnwell"&mdash;a title which H. J. Byron
altered to "George De Barnwell" when in 1862 he travestied
the old play at the Adelphi.</p>

<p>Home's "Douglas", which was given to the public in
1756, appears to have escaped stage satire until 1837,
when it was taken in hand by William Leman Rede. The
Adelphi was the scene of the production, and the performers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
included "O." Smith as Glenalvon, J. Reeve as Norval,
and Mrs. Stirling as Lady Randolph. The piece does not
supply very exhilarating reading. The ultra-familiar soliloquy,
"My name is Norval," is here put into lyric form,
and comes out as <span class="nwrp">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My name is Norval, sir; upon the Grampian Hills<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Tol lol, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have already seen that, in his "Quadrupeds of
Quedlinburgh," Colman junior extracted some fun out of
scenes in "The Stranger," "Pizarro," and "Timour the
Tartar." The first of these plays was made the subject of
more elaborate satire in 1868, when Mr. Robert Reece
wrote for the New Queen's Theatre his burlesque called
"The Stranger, Stranger than Ever!" This, with Miss
Santley as Peter, Mr. Lionel Brough as the Stranger, and
Miss Henrietta Hodson as Mrs. Haller, had many points
of attraction. In this <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> the lady's chief
complaint is that her husband first neglected her and then
deserted her, taking away the children. Moreover, "he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
taught the infants all the comic songs," and so, "instead
of gloating over Peter Parley, the boy declared himself as
Champagne Charley." In despair the deserted one set to
work and took in <span class="nwrp">washing:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You'll ask, "why washing?"&mdash;give your fancy scope:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that profession while there's life there's <em>soap</em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I to live?&mdash;of course came this suggestion!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<em>Tub</em> be or not <em>tub</em> be?" that <em>was</em> the question.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with a will I turned me to my work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried a <em>blue bag</em> like a lawyer's clerk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still I grieved&mdash;the trade's of woe prolific,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I couldn't sleep, for all this <em>soap-horrific</em>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard was my lot, for I could plainly see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My source of living must end <em>sud</em>-denly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her downward course, say, what could stop her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sole subsistence was a single <em>copper</em>?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As usual with Mr. Reece, the puns are excellent. Tobias
says of the stranger that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each evening you may see him sitting so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under that <em>linden when the sun was low</em>;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His noble <em>eye, sir, rolling rapidly</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the Stranger says to <span class="nwrp">Peter:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Mrs. Haller's gifts you showed,<br /></span>

<p>Of his <span class="nwrp">wife:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i0">When first I married thee (then somewhat shady),<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But, in truth, there is no end to these <i>jeux-de-mots</i>.</p>

<p>"Pizarro," which nowadays has quite gone out of the
theatrical repertory, was dealt with from the comic point
of view by Leicester Buckingham, whose "Pizarro, or the
Leotard of Peru," was seen at the Strand in 1862, with
Johnny Clarke as the hero, and Miss Swanborough, Miss
Charlotte Saunders, Miss Bufton, Miss Fanny Josephs, Miss
Fanny Hughes, and Rogers, in other parts. Of the "literature"
of this piece the following is a very fair example: it
is supposed to be spoken by <span class="nwrp">Rolla:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The Wood-Demon," by "Monk" Lewis, played originally
in 1811, suggested to Albert Smith and Charles Kenny
a travestie, of the same name, which they brought out at
the Lyceum in 1847. "Timour the Tartar," another of
Lewis's dramas, received equally satiric treatment at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
hands of John Oxenford and Shirley Brooks, whose work
made its appearance at the Olympic in 1860. In the
last-named year Messrs. Francis Talfourd and H. J. Byron
founded on Pocock's "Miller and his Men" (1813) a
"mealy-drama," similarly entitled, which was played at the
Strand.</p>

<p>Jerrold's "Black-ey'd Susan," first performed in 1822,
waited till 1866 for the travestie by Mr. Burnand, to which
I have already adverted. This "Latest Edition of Black-eyed
Susan, or the Little Bill that was Taken Up,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> was
made specially gay by a wealth of song and dance; but
it had other merits. Here, for instance, is an amusing
soliloquy by Dame <span class="nwrp">Hatley:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Five years after the production of Jerrold's play, the
London stage was surfeited for a time with adaptations from
the French, all bearing upon the evils of the gaming-table.
These bore such titles as "The Gambler's Fate," "Thirty
Years of a Gambler's Life," and so on, and were brought
out at Drury Lane, the Surrey (by Elliston), and the
Adelphi (by Terry and Yates). They did not last,
however; and "The Elbow-Shakers, or Thirty Years of a
Rattler's Life," in which Fox Cooper made fun of them,
was scarcely needed to effect their overthrow. Reeve and
Yates were the two Elbow-Shakers, but the piece had little
intrinsic value.</p>

<p>In 1867, at the Haymarket, Mr. Gilbert Arthur a'Beckett
brought out a travestie of Planché's "Brigand" (1829),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
under the title of "The Brigand, or New Lines to an
Old Ban-Ditty." In this, Massaroni, the hero, was represented
by Compton as a poltroon, objecting very much
to the dictation of Marie Grazia as portrayed by Ione
Burke. Young Mr. Kendal also had a part in this production.
Nor had we yet done with the old school of
melodrama. Yet another specimen thereof was destined
to come under the lash of the parodist&mdash;namely, the piece
called "My Poll and my Partner Joe," written by J. T.
Haines, first seen at the Surrey in 1838, and interpreted
by T. P. Cooke as Harry Halyard, R. Honner as Joe
Tiller, and Miss Honner as Poll (Mary Maybud). The
"happy thought" of burlesquing this typical piece came
to Mr. Burnand, who, in his travestie named after the
original, made, at the St. James's in 1871, a success second
only to that of "Black-ey'd Susan." It was in this
burlesque that Mrs. John Wood (as Mary) had so notable
a triumph with her song, "His Heart was true to Poll,"
which she still sings sometimes in public. Miss Emma
Chambers was the Harry in this piece, and Mr. Lionel
Brough the Black Brandon, with Harry Cox, Gaston
Murray, and Miss Sallie Turner in other parts.</p>

<p>Now comes the turn of the poetic drama, as represented
in and by the works of Lord Byron, Sergeant Talfourd,
the first Lord Lytton, and Mr. W. S. Gilbert. The first of
Lord Byron's plays to be burlesqued was "Manfred," which
fell to the lot of Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett in 1834. In the
"burlesque ballet opera," called "Man-Fred," which thus
issued from A'Beckett's pen, Man-Fred figured as a
master-sweep, very much perturbed and disturbed by the
Act in reference to chimney-sweeping which had just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
passed, and which, he plaintively declares, has killed the
<span class="nwrp">trade:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That horrible new act has marr'd his pleasure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It really was a very <em>sweeping</em> measure.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His lady-love, Ann Starkie, is equally unfortunate in her
business&mdash;that of apple-seller. As she <span class="nwrp">remarks:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The trade is at a stand," the people whine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it be at a <em>stand</em>, 'tis not at mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain down Fleet Street with my wares I go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Fleet they call the street, its trade is slow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the course of the piece Ann appears disguised as
Mme. Grisi, and some badinage is directed at the "stars"
of the Italian Opera.</p>

<p>A'Beckett further undertook, along with Mark Lemon, a
skit upon another of the Byronic dramas&mdash;"Sardanapalus"&mdash;which
they reproduced as "Sardanapalus, or the 'Fast'
King of Assyria." The Adelphi was the theatre of
operations; 1853 was the year; and while Miss Woolgar
was Sardanapalus, Paul Bedford was Arbaces, Keeley was
Salymenia (mother of the Queen), Miss Maskell was
Beleses, and Miss Mary Keeley was Altada. Arbaces is
here shown as impervious to the charm of <span class="nwrp">melody:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such music to my ears is a mere hum;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of minims let me have the minimum.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Salymenia says to the King's <span class="nwrp">favourite:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your conduct, madam, 's not at all correct:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you're a Myrrha, why don't you reflect?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of such are the quips and the quiddities with which the
piece abounds.</p>

<p>In 1858 came, from the workshop of H. J. Byron, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
first travestie of his "noble kinsman's" play, "Mazeppa."
This, produced at the Olympic, had Robson for its hero,
with other parts in the hands of Horace Wigan, Mr. Lewis
Ball, Miss Wyndham, Miss Bromley, and Mrs. W. S. Emden.
Of its punning dialogue, which throughout is in the genuine
H. J. Byronic manner, the following is a fair example.
Olinska is conversing with her father, the <span class="nwrp">Castellan:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Oli.</i> You hate romance,&mdash;are one of its deriders.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And although landlords show each quarter day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They show <em>no quarter</em> when you do not pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your poet-spouse grows thin, and daily racks his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor brains to pay the butcher or the taxes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Oli.</i> A verse would pay the tax-man all we owed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cas</i> (<i class="stage-direction">aside</i>). I think he'd be <em>averse</em>, though, to that mode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see with <em>my</em> eyes, if I could but make her!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Oli.</i> With a few <em>flowery</em> lines we'd pay the baker.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">With enthusiasm</i>) Tradesmen with <em>gentle</em> feelings we'd pay so, sir;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A poet never yet was a great eater,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'd pay the butcher with a little <em>meat-a</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The subject of "Mazeppa" was afterwards treated by Mr.
Burnand in a burlesque brought out at the Gaiety in 1885.</p>

<p>Of Sergeant Talfourd's dramatic works the only one,
apparently, that has been travestied is "Ion," which had to
submit to the ridicule of Fox Cooper in 1836. In that year
Cooper's perversion was played both at the Garrick Theatre
and at the Queen's, in the first case with Conquest as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
hero, in the latter with a lady in the <i>rôle</i>&mdash;an arrangement
quite defensible, inasmuch as, in the original play, the
name-part had been played (at the Haymarket) by Ellen
Tree.</p>

<p>The pseudo-Elizabethanisms of Sheridan Knowles
naturally attracted the attention of the comic playwrights.
The opportunities were, indeed, only too tempting; and so
I have to record the production of burlesques based upon
five plays&mdash;"The Wife," "Virginius," "Alfred the Great,"
"William Tell," and "The Hunchback." The first named
has for its full title "The Wife: a Tale of Mantua." The
"burlesque burletta," by Joseph Graves (Strand, 1837),
is called "The Wife: a Tale of a Mantua Maker."
Mariana (first played by Ellen Tree) here becomes Mary
Ann Phipps, the said mantua-maker; Floribel is Flora, a
servant-of-all-work. Leonardo and Ferrardo Gonzaga figure
as Marmaduke Jago, landlord of the Green Man, and
Zachariah Jago, usurping that dignity; Count Florio is
Floor'em (a police-sergeant), Julian St. Pierre is Jack
Peters&mdash;and so forth. The travestie is fairly close, but the
wit and humour are not of brilliant quality. Even less to
be commended is "Virginius the Rum 'Un," perpetrated
by William Rogers, the comedian, and performed at Sadler's
Wells in the same year as Graves's effort. This is but a
tedious assault upon "Virginius." The scene is laid in
Islington, and Virginius is a butcher. Appius Claudius,
here called Sappyis, is a sergeant of police. Dentatus is
"Tentaties"; Icilius is "Isilyus." Claudius claims Virginia
as his apprentice, and Virginius stabs her with a skewer;
the instrument, however, sticks only in her stay-bone, and
so no harm is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Virginius" had very much more justice done to it when
Leicester Buckingham made it the basis of a burlesque at
the St. James's in 1859. Then Charles Young was the
Virginius, Mrs. Frank Matthews the Virginia, and Miss Lydia
Thompson a "Mysterious Stranger," introduced, apparently,
only for the sake of a <i>pas seul</i>. In this piece the puns are
very plentiful, if not always good. Thus, Virginia <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, deary me! each day I'm growing thinner:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And to the words I spoke, on his arm leaning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love lent a sigh to give a <em>si-lent</em> meaning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he said nothing soft&mdash;that's what I cry for;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sigh for one whose heart I can't de<em>ci-pher</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Virginius, like so many other burlesque characters,
delivers himself of a reminiscence of "To be or not to
be," and at the close it is found that Virginius has not
really killed his daughter, because she "pads."</p>

<p>"Alfred the Great," one of Knowles' historical plays,
suggested portions of the burlesque called "Alfred the
Great, or the Minstrel King," which Robert B. Brough
wrote for the Olympic in 1859. In this, Robson was the
King, Miss Herbert his aide-de-camp, and F. Vining his
commander-in-chief, with other parts by Horace Wigan
and Miss Hughes. Knowles's "William Tell" (1825), or
the story embodied in it has been the basis of half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
a dozen travesties. First came Mr. Burnand's "William
Tell," at Drury Lane, in 1856; next, Leicester Buckingham's,
at the Strand, in 1857; next, Talfourd's "Tell! and the
Strike of the Cantons, or the Pair, the Meddler, and the
Apple!" at the Strand, in 1859-60; next, again, Byron's
"William Tell with a Vengeance! or the Pet, the Parrot,
and the Pippin," at the Strand, in 1867; a few days later,
A. J. O'Neill's "William Tell," at Sadler's Wells; and,
lastly&mdash;so far&mdash;Mr. Reece's "William Tell told Over Again,"
at the Gaiety, in 1876. "The Hunchback" has been
"guyed" less often than might have been expected, considering
its popularity. Mr. Burnand brought out at the
Olympic, in 1879, "The Hunchback Back Again," and
this comic version of the hackneyed old play is not likely
to be superseded.</p>

<p>The first Lord Lytton's verse-plays&mdash;bristling as they do
with fustian and bombast&mdash;have naturally been frequently
travestied. Note the number of occasions on which "The
Lady of Lyons" has fallen a prey to the irreverent. Altogether
there have been six notable burlesques of this drama. H. J.
Byron wrote two, the first of which&mdash;"The Latest Edition
of the Lady of Lyons"&mdash;was produced at the Strand in
1858. This, in the following year, was freshened up and
re-presented to the public as "The Very Latest Edition" of
the popular drama.</p>

<p>In 1878, at the Gaiety, came Mr. Herman Merivale's
"vaudeville," "The Lady of Lyons Married and Settled,"
which is not only quite the best of the travesties on this topic,
but one of the cleverest ever written. It sparkles with good
things from beginning to end. Claude, it seems, has "taken
to philosophy, and says we are all descended from monkeys."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
It is not surprising, therefore, to find him singing a long
song in praise of the Darwinian <span class="nwrp">theory:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This has some claim to rank with the ditties on the same
subject by Lord Neaves and Mortimer Collins. But Claude
has also gone in for something less innocent than Darwinianism.
He is flirting with Babette, a pretty laundry-maid, the
beloved of Gaspar. Of her, Gaspar sings as follows, in
a clever parody of "Sally in our <span class="nwrp">Alley":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Yet shall she wash my Sunday suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tho' she my suit refuses,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When I bestow the lordly franc,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis sweet to hear her "Thankee"&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You'd love to kiss her rosy lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, ah! she'll never let 'ee!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the course of the piece there is a good deal of direct
parody of Lytton's style, both in prose and verse. For
example, Claude says at one point to <span class="nwrp">Babette:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Come with me to my mother's lonely cot! I have preserved it ever
in memory of mine early youth; and, believe me, that the prize of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
virtue never, beneath my father's honest roof, even villains dared to
mar! Now, maiden, now, I think thou wilt believe me! Wilt come?</p>

<p><i>Babette.</i> I wilt!</p></blockquote>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the sweet suburb of Richemont or Tedainton, on the banks of the
broad Garonne, one of those expensive spots where, during the summer
months, the river is at the bottom of the lawn&mdash;during the winter, the
lawn at the bottom of the river&mdash;but where it is damp-pleasant all
the year round; there will we babble to the murmuring stream, and
the babbling stream shall murmur back to us, and softly whisper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dowager Morier</i> (<i class="stage-direction">coming down</i>). Hold on!<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After Mr. Merivale's piece came one on the same
subject by Mr. W. Younge (1879); another by Mr. Clifton
(Lyne), played in the country in 1882; and yet another,
by Mr. Reece (also played in the country) in 1884. This
last was entitled "The Lady of Lyons Married and Claude
Unsettled."</p>

<p>Ten years after the first burlesque of "The Lady of
Lyons" appeared the first burlesque of Lord Lytton's
"Rightful Heir." This was "The Frightful Hair" of
Mr. Burnand, seen at the Haymarket in 1868-9. In 1868
also, publicity was given to "The Right-Fall Heir" of
Mr. H. T. Arden.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1873 Mr. Irving revived at the
Lyceum Lord Lytton's "Richelieu," and the play was
speedily followed at the Olympic by the "Richelieu Redressed"
of Mr. Reece. This is remarkable, to begin with,
as being written throughout in blank verse&mdash;an agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
departure from the time-honoured couplet. The general
travestie is close, and there is a certain amount of direct
parody, as where Richelieu is made to say that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the great Lexicon of Politics<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no such word as Truth!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the "curse of Rome" scene, Richelieu draws around
himself "the awful circle of the Daily Press!" Fun,
too, is made of the well-known exit of Baradas at the
words "All in despite of my lord Cardinal," and also of
the various ways in which actors are wont to pronounce
the simple word "Julie." The piece has a strong political
flavour throughout, in compliment, no doubt, to the general
election, which was then in prospect. Richelieu thus
<span class="nwrp">soliloquises:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>It was characteristic of Mr. W. S. Gilbert that he should
himself set the example of burlesquing his own work. I
have already made reference to "The Happy Land," the
travestie of his "Wicked World," which he and Mr. Gilbert
Arthur a'Beckett prepared for the Court Theatre in 1873.
It was in this piece that the personal appearance of three
prominent living statesmen was closely imitated by certain
of the performers, with the result of bringing down upon
the culprits the veto of His High-and-Mightiness the Lord
Chamberlain. In 1876 two of Mr. Gilbert's plays were
burlesqued&mdash;"Broken Hearts" and "Dan'l Druce"; the
former under the name of "Cracked Heads," the latter
under that of "Dan'l Tra-Duced"; both being brought out
at the same theatre&mdash;the Strand, and both being the work
of the same author&mdash;Mr. Arthur Clements, who, however,
had in "Cracked Heads" the assistance of Mr. Frederick
Hay. "Dan'l Druce" was not a particularly good subject;
but "Broken Heads," with its occasionally overstrained
sentiment, was fairly open to polite ridicule. In the original,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the Lady Vavir feigns love for a sun-dial, while the
Lady Hilda expends much sentiment upon a streamlet. In
"Cracked Heads" the Lady Vapid bestows her affections
upon a clock, and the Lady Tilda hers upon a pump.
Says the latter to the <span class="nwrp">former:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why do you love the clock, good sister? tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vapid.</i> The earth goes round; the moon, with silvery smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The p'lice cerulean who the cooks beguile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The turncock, too, precursor of the spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The German band, and all that sort of thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most things go round, in fact; and who shall mock?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clock goes round: that's why I love the clock.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this genial little piece, presented at the Strand
in 1876, Mr. Edward Terry was the monster, here called
Monsta; Miss Lottie Venne and Miss Angelina Claude
were the ladies Tilda and Vapid, and Mr. Harry Cox was
the Prince Florian, here called Dorian. It will be remembered,
by the way, that it has been the fate of one of
Mr. Gilbert's comic operas to be parodied&mdash;surely a case of
gilding refined gold! The opera was "Ruddigore," which
was chaffed, more or less effectively, in the little <i>pièce
d'occasion</i> called "Ruddy George, or Robin Redbreast,"
brought out at Toole's Theatre in 1887.</p>

<p>The melodrama of the last half-century has received due
attention at the hands of the stage satirists. Buckstone's
"Green Bushes," for example, had its comic counterpart
in H. J. Byron's "Grin Bushes," performed at the Strand
in 1864. It was Byron, too, who burlesqued Boucicault's
"Colleen Bawn," under the title of "Little Eily O'Connor"
(Drury Lane, 1861). The story of Rip Van Winkle, made
so popular in England by Mr. Jefferson, has been handled
in the spirit of travestie both by Mr. Reece (at the Folly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
1876) and by Mr. H. Savile Clarke (in 1880). "The Lights
o' London" suggested "The De-lights of London" (1882),
which we owed to the co-operation of Messrs. Mackay,
Lennard, and Gordon. After "The Silver King" came
"Silver Guilt," a clever piece by Mr. Warham St. Leger, in
which, at the Strand in 1883, Miss Laura Linden imitated
Miss Eastlake to admiration. In like manner, after
"Claudian" came the diverting "Paw Claw-dian" of Mr.
Burnand, which, at Toole's in 1884, gave Miss Marie
Linden the opportunity of emulating (as Almi-i-da) her
sister's success. In this piece Mr. Toole, as Claudian,
and E. D. Ward, as Coal-Holey Clement, were particularly
amusing. "Chatterton," another of Mr. Wilson Barrett's
triumphs, has lately reappeared, disguised as "Shatter'd
Un"&mdash;the author in this instance being Mr. A. Chevalier.
"In the Ranks" naturally led to the production of "Out
of the Ranks" (by Mr. Reece, Strand, 1884); and "Called
Back" was found especially provocative of ridicule, no fewer
than three travesties being written&mdash;Mr. Herman Merivale's
"Called There and Back" (Gaiety, 1884), Mr. Yardley's
"The Scalded Back" (Novelty, 1884), and Mr. Chevalier's
"Called Back again" (Plymouth, 1885).</p>

<p>In 1888 Mrs. Bernard Beere was playing at the Opéra
Comique in "Ariane," a rather full-blooded drama by
Mrs. Campbell Praed. This was at once burlesqued at the
Strand by Mr. Burnand, whose "Airey Annie" (as rendered
by Mr. Edouin, Miss Atherton, and Miss Ayrtoun) proved
to be a very mirth-provoking product. The heroine, Airey
Annie thus accounted for her <span class="nwrp">sobriquet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A gutter child, a true Bohemian girl,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>

<span class="i0">And up and down the airey steps I strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the little boys about began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To call me by the name of "Airey Anne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among miscellaneous satires upon the conventional stage
products may be named Byron's "Rosebud of Stinging-Nettle
Farm" (Crystal Palace, 1862), Mr. Reece's "Brown
and the Brahmins" (Globe, 1869), and Mr. Matthison's
"More than Ever" (Gaiety and Court, 1882)&mdash;the last-named
being written in ridicule of the modern Surrey-side
"blood-curdler."</p>

<p>So much for the travestie of English melodrama. When
we come to deal with the burlesque of melodrama derived
from the French, a large field opens out before us. Going
back to 1850, we find that Hugo's "Nôtre Dame," as
dramatised in England, has suggested to Albert Smith
a comic piece called "Esmeralda," brought out at the
Adelphi. The subject is next taken up by H. J. Byron, whose
"Esmeralda or the 'Sensation' Goat" belongs to the Strand
and 1861. Then Fanny Josephs was the Esmeralda, Marie
Wilton the Gringoire, Eleanor Bufton the Phoebus, Clarke
the Quasimodo, and Rogers the Claude Frollo. Gringoire
was made to introduce himself in this punning <span class="nwrp">fashion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1879, at the Gaiety, Byron returned to the topic, and
produced the piece which he called "Pretty Esmeralda."
At the same theatre, in 1887, one saw the same subject
treated in the "Miss Esmeralda" of Messrs. F. Leslie
and H. Mills&mdash;a piece in which Miss Marion Hood, as the
heroine, played prettily to the Frollo of Mr. E. J. Lonnen,
and in which the late George Stone laid the foundation of
his too brief success.</p>

<p>Boucicault's version of "Les Frères Corses" was produced
in London by Charles Kean in 1852, and was quickly
followed by a travestie. This was furnished by Gilbert
Abbott a'Beckett and Mark Lemon at the Haymarket (April,
1852), under the title of "O Gemini! or the Brothers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Co(u)rse." Those who did not witness the production can
nevertheless conceive how droll Buckstone must have
been as the Brothers, and how well he was supported by
Bland, also in a dual <i>rôle</i>&mdash;that of Meynard and Montgiron
(or Montegridiron, as he was called)&mdash;and by Mrs. L. S.
Buckingham as Chateau Renaud. The burlesque was not
wholly of the punning sort; it relied chiefly upon its
travestie of the incidents in the original play. Fabien was
made to give (to the sound of "low music") the following
account of the extraordinary sympathy existing between
himself and his <span class="nwrp">brother:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>H. J. Byron, who travestied nearly everything, of course
did not let the "Corsican Brothers" escape him, and his
"Corsican 'Bothers'" duly figured at the Globe in 1869.
Messrs. Burnand and H. P. Stephens followed, at the Gaiety
in 1880, with "The Corsican Brothers &amp; Co.," and in 1881
(at the Royalty) Mr. G. R. Sims made his <i>début</i> as a writer
of burlesque with "The Of Course-Akin-Brothers, Babes
in the Wood." In this he began the action with Fabien
and Louis as the Babes and Chateau Renaud as the Wicked
Uncle, introducing a certain Rosie Posie, who is maid to
Mme. dei Franchi and sweetheart of Alfred Meynard. At
the end of the first scene Father Time came on, and
summed up the situation in a <span class="nwrp">song:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i8">Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho!<br /></span>

<p>Previous to the first entry of Louis' ghost, Fabien <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I feel so strange, I know poor Loo is seedy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dreamt I saw his ghost all pale and bleedy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll write him. Where's the ink? Lor, how I shudder!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This <em>goes to</em> prove I want a drop of brandy.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the other puns in the piece the following are perhaps
fair specimens. At the <i>bal masqué</i>, Louis, meeting Emilie
de Lesparre, <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Louis.</i> My dagger awaits you&mdash;for your blood I faint!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Renaud.</i> Your dagger awaits&mdash;you'<em>d aggerawate</em> a saint.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the final tableau, Chateau Renaud is advised to take
some brandy; but he asks instead for "a go of gin&mdash;I want
the <em>gin-go</em> spirit."</p>

<p>The latest of the burlesques on this subject was supplied&mdash;also
for the Royalty&mdash;by Mr. Cecil Raleigh, whose "New
Corsican Brothers" played in 1889, had more than one
whimsical feature to recommend it. One of the brothers
(Mr. Arthur Roberts) was supposed to be an English linen-draper,
who, whenever anything was happening to the other
brother, had a wild desire to measure out tape&mdash;and so on.
The dialogue was in prose.</p>

<p>"Belphegor," the generic name bestowed upon the
numerous adaptations of "Paillasse," gave birth to at least
one travestie of importance&mdash;that by Leicester Buckingham,
which saw the light at the Strand in 1856, the year in
which Charles Dillon played in one of the adaptations (at the
Lyceum). "The Duke's Motto," in which Fechter "starred"
at the same theatre, was the origin of H. J. Byron's "The
Motto: I am 'All There'"&mdash;a piece seen at the Strand in
1863, with Miss Maria Simpson as the Duke Gonzaque,
George Honey as Lagardère, and Ada Swanborough and
Fanny Josephs as Blanche and Pepita. Among much
which is mere punning, though deter enough for that
commodity, I find this little bit of social <span class="nwrp">satire:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Smiles, shaking hands, smirks, simpers, and what not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throw in the greengrocer, and serve up hot.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is to H. J. Byron that we owe the burlesque of
"Robert Macaire," which, with Fanny Josephs and J. Clarke
as Macaire and Strop, brightened the boards of the Globe
Theatre in 1870. The drama of which Ruy Blas is the
central figure has been twice travestied among us&mdash;once
in 1873 by Mr. Reece ("Ruy Blas Righted," at the
Vaudeville), and more recently (in 1889) by Messrs. F.
Leslie and H. Clark ("Ruy Blas, or the Blasé Roué,"
at the Gaiety). "Diplomacy," adapted from "Dora,"
appealed to Mr. Burnand's sense of the ridiculous, and
the result was "Dora and Diplunacy" (Strand, 1878),
in which the weak spots of the original were divertingly
laid bare. In the same year, Mr. Burnand burlesqued, at
the Royalty, his own adaptation, "Proof, or a Celebrated
Case," under the title of "Over-Proof, or What was Found
in a Celebrated Case." To 1879 belong two clever travesties&mdash;"Another
Drink," by Messrs. Savile Clarke and Clifton
(Lyne), suggested by "Drink," and brought out at the
Folly; and "Under-Proof," Mr. Edward Rose's <i lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</i> of "Proof." In the latter piece, besides many
well-constructed puns, there are many pleasant turns of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
humour, as when Pierre satirises the conventional stage
pronunciation of his <span class="nwrp">name:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In my native land, as you're aware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Christian name's pronounced like this&mdash;Pi-erre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here I'm made a nobleman of France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For everybody calls me <em>Peer</em> Lorance.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of the Anglo-French melodrama of recent years, Mr.
Burnand has been the frequent and successful satirist.
He capped "Fedora" with "Stage-Dora" (Toole's, 1883),
"Theodora" with "The O'Dora" (same theatre, 1885), and
"La Tosca" with "Tra la la Tosca" (Royalty, 1890). This
last contained some of the happiest of its author's efforts, in
the way both of ingenious punning and effective rhyming.
Here, for example, is a song put into the mouth of the
Baron Scarpia, the "villain" both of the play and of the
<span class="nwrp">travestie:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>During the present year, the interest gradually excited
by successive performances of plays by Henrik Ibsen
has culminated in the production of the inevitable burlesques.
More than one clever travestie of Ibsen has
been printed&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, those by Mr. J. P. Hurst and Mr.
Wilton Jones; but the first to be performed was that
entitled "Ibsen's Ghost, or Toole up to Date," which is
from the witty pen of Mr. J. M. Barrie. This starts
as a sort of sequel to "Hedda Gabler," which it mainly
satirises; but there are allusions also to "Ghosts" and
to "A Doll's House," with some general sarcasm at the
expense of Ibsen's peculiarities. The dialogue is in prose,
with a concluding vocal quartett; the writer's touch is as
light as it is true; and the composition, as a whole, is
thoroughly exhilarating. The three-act piece, "The Gifted
Lady," in which Mr. Robert Buchanan sought to ridicule
not only Ibsen but other "emancipating" agencies of the
time, was, unfortunately, not so successful as Mr. Barrie's
slighter and brighter work. It abounded in excellent
epigram, but lacked geniality and humour. In "Ibsen's
Ghost" Mr. Toole and Miss Eliza Johnstone renewed
old successes, while Miss Irene Vanbrugh gave signs of
aptitude for burlesque. In "The Gifted Lady" Miss
Fanny Brough, Miss Cicely Richards, Mr. W. H. Vernon,
and Mr. Harry Paulton showed all their usual skill, but,
unfortunately, to no purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BURLESQUE OF OPERA.</p>


<p>We have already seen that, in burlesquing mythology,
faërie, and other matters, our comic playwrights
have not been able to resist the temptation to introduce
occasional travesties of things operatic. Opera, indeed,
has always had a magnetic power over them. They have
been unable to maintain their gravity in presence of the
singularities which distinguish opera, even in its most
modern guise, from the more natural and realistic drama.
Operatic conditions demand, of necessity, certain stereotyped
regulations, especially of stage management, which
detract from probability and excite derision. Especially is
this so in the case of the older school of Opera, and notably
in that of the Italian school, whose products were largely on
the same simple and ingenuous model&mdash;a model on which
the travestie writers were able to construct some genuinely
entertaining imitations.</p>

<p>Beginning, then, with the Italian school, we note that
Donizetti has been particularly favoured by the parodists.
His "Lucrezia Borgia," "Linda di Chamouni," "Elisir
d' Amore," and "Fille du Régiment" have all had to
submit to deliberate perversion. Of "Lucrezia" there have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
been three notable burlesques&mdash;one by Leicester Buckingham,
at the St. James's, in 1860; another by Sydney
French, at the Marylebone, in 1867; and the third by
H. J. Byron, at the Holborn, in 1868. Buckingham's was
entitled "Lucrezia Borgia! at Home, and all Abroad," and
had Charles Young for the exponent of the title character.
Miss Wyndham was Johnny Raw ("known as Gennaro,
through the defective pronunciation of his Italian friends&mdash;a
British shopkeeper, who has left for awhile the countertenor
of his way, and is travelling on the Continent for his
pleasure"). Miss Cecilia Ranoe was Alfonso, and a small
part was played by Miss Nellie Moore. Lucrezia figures
in this piece as a dabbler in monetary speculations, the
failure of which gives opportunity for a speech parodying
some Shakespearean lines with more freshness than such
things usually <span class="nwrp">possess:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! that dishonoured notes of hand would melt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thaw, and dissolve themselves when overdue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never leave the holder time to sue;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No, not two months; six weeks is less than eight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So excellent a bill! The blow will floor me!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I've turned my back, and yet I see thee still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou then be two gentlemen at will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or art thou but a grim dissolving view&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I see thee yet&mdash;so palpable in form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My prospects seem uncomfortably warm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou marshall'st me to Whitecross Street, I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clutching protested bills endorsed by me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indictments, too, for fraud and false pretences!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else I'm tight! I see thee still, my man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by thy side appears the prison van,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was not so before. There's no such thing!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the course of the piece, Johnny Raw is poisoned by
Alfonso with publican's port, and afterwards Lucrezia seeks
to destroy Orsini and his companion with London milk.
Byron's burlesque on the subject was called "Lucrezia
Borgia, M.D."</p>

<p>"Linda di Chamouni" exercised the wit both of Mr.
Conway Edwardes and of Mr. Alfred Thompson. The
former writer's "Linda di Chamouni, or the Blighted
Flower," was played at Bath in 1869; the latter's work
was presented, later in the same year, at the Gaiety. In
Mr. Edwardes' book one is most struck by the multiplicity
and occasional felicity of the "word-plays." Here, for
instance, is what Pierotto says when he is asked to take
a cup of <span class="nwrp">wine:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, if you ask me <em>what</em> I'll take, I think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tea I prefer 'bove every other drink.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And if I were engaged in deadly strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd stab my en'my with a <em>Bohea</em> knife.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>Two of Donizetti's operas&mdash;"L'Elisir d'Amore" and "La
Fille du Régiment"&mdash;were travestied by Mr. W. S. Gilbert;
the former under the title of "Doctor Dulcamara, or the
Little Duck and the Great Quack," the latter under that
of "La Vivandière, or True to the Corps." "Doctor
Dulcamara" was played at the St. James's, with Frank
Matthews in the title-part. "La Vivandière" (1868) was
written for the Queen's Theatre, where it employed the
talents of Miss Henrietta Hodson, Mr. Toole, Mr. Lionel
Brough, Miss Everard (the original Little Buttercup), and
Miss Fanny Addison.</p>

<p>Of Verdi's operas two have been singled out for special
attention&mdash;"Il Trovatore" and "Ernani." The first of
these suggested H. J. Byron's "Ill-Treated Trovatore,"
seen at the Adelphi in 1863, and another version by the
same hand, played at the Olympic seventeen years after.
Byron also wrote a travestie of "Ernani," which he called
"Handsome Hernani" (Gaiety, 1879); but in this he had
been anticipated by William Brough, whose work was seen
at the Alexandra Theatre in 1865.</p>

<p>Three travesties have been founded on the "La Sonnambula"
of Bellini. The first, which was played at the
Victoria Theatre in 1835, was from the pen of Gilbert
Abbott a'Beckett, and entitled "The Roof Scrambler"&mdash;a
title explained in lines spoken by Rudolpho and
<span class="nwrp">Swelvino:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

course, is Elvino. He is a sexton, and has plighted his troth
to Lizzy; but before the piece opens, he has transferred
his affections to Molly Brown, a charity girl&mdash;"a Greasy
Roamer over the tops of houses." Swelvino and Molly are
about to be married, when there arrives at the village
Rodolpho, the new Inspector of Police, who introduces
himself as <span class="nwrp">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, here I am again!&mdash;I know this scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which, when I was young, so oft I've been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I recognise each spot I see around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stocks know me, and well I know the pound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sight of these my eyes with tears is filling:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew that pound when I had not a shilling!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Molly, walking in her sleep, enters Rodolpho's apartment,
and is found there by Swelvino, but is vindicated, like her
prototype in the opera, by being subsequently discovered in
a somnambulant condition. The story of "La Sonnambula"
is, in fact, followed closely, but caricatured throughout. W.
Rogers, who was the Swelvino, and Mitchell, who was the
Molly, appear to have been highly successful in exciting the
hilarity of their audiences. The latter portrayed the heroine
as "a waddling, thick-set, red-and-ruddy, blowzy-faced goblin,
with turn-up nose and carroty hair, wrapt in a pea-soup or
camomile-tea-coloured negligée, and carrying," in the sleep-walking
scene, "a farthing rushlight in one of Day &amp;
Martin's empty blacking-bottles." Of Swelvino's appearance
we may judge from a remark made by Molly to her <span class="nwrp">lover:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, by looking in your face, can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are your feelings excellently well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes! the fulness of that ruby nose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your love for me doth passing well disclose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your agitated whisker shows full well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What throbs of passion underneath it dwell!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>The two other skits upon the opera were the work of H. J.
Byron, who produced the first at the Prince of Wales's in
1865, under the title of "La! Sonnambula! or the Supper,
the Sleeper, and the Merry Swiss Boy; being a passage in
the life of a famous 'Woman in White': a passage leading
to a tip-top story." Miss Marie Wilton was the Merry
Swiss Boy (Alessio); Miss Fanny Josephs was Elvino; Mr.
Dewar, Rodolpho; "Johnny" Clarke, Amina; Miss Bella
Goodall, Lisa; Mr. Harry Cox undertaking the <i>rôle</i> of "a
virtuous peasant (by the kind permission of the Legitimate
Drama)." This was Miss Wilton's first production at the
Prince of Wales's, and it was a great success. In 1878
Byron brought out at the Gaiety a piece which he called
"Il Sonnambulo, or Lively Little Alessio." In this he
introduced several variations on the operatic story; making
the Count (Edward Terry) the somnambulist, instead of
Amina&mdash;in burlesque of Mr. Henry Neville's sleep-walking
scene in Wilkie Collins's "Moonstone." Miss Farren was
the lively little Alessio, and Mr. Royce the "local tenor,"
Elvino.</p>

<p>Of Bellini's "Norma" the first burlesque produced was
that which W. H. Oxberry, the comedian, contributed to
the Haymarket in 1841. In this the title-part was played
by Paul Bedford, with Wright as Adalgisa and Mrs. H. P.
Grattan as Pollio. The piece had no literary pretensions,
and it would be unfair to compare it, in that or any other
respect, with "The Pretty Druidess, or the Mother, the
Maid, and the Mistletoe Bough," which Mr. W. S. Gilbert
wrote for the Charing Cross Theatre (now Toole's) just
twenty-eight years later. This was one of the best of Mr.
Gilbert's operatic travesties, the dialogue being characterised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
by especial point and neatness. Here, for example, is the
advice given by Norma (Miss Hughes) to the ladies presiding
over the stalls at a fancy fair. Hamlet's address
to the players is very happily <span class="nwrp">suggested:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With pretty speech accost both old and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak it trippingly upon the tongue;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out-Rachels Rachel!&mdash;pray you, girls, avoid it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither be ye too tame&mdash;but, ere you go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provide yourselves with sprigs of mistletoe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offer them coyly to the Roman herd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But don't you "suit the action to the word,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the very torrent of your passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember modesty is still in fashion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, there be ladies whom I've seen hold stalls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ladies of rank, my dear&mdash;to whom befalls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither the accent nor the gait of ladies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clumsily made up with Bloom of Cadiz,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Powder-rouge&mdash;lip-salve&mdash;that I've fancied then<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The "Gazza Ladra" of Rossini lives on the burlesque
stage in the counterfeit presentment furnished by Byron's
"Maid and the Magpie, or the Fatal Spoon." This was one
of the writer's greatest triumphs in the field of travestie.
Produced at the Strand in 1854, with Miss Oliver as Ninette,
Miss Marie Wilton as Pippo, Bland as Fernando, and Clarke
as Isaac (the old-clothes man), it at once hit the public
taste, as it well deserved to do, for it is full of clever writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and ingenious incidents. The best scene of all, perhaps,
is that in which the broken-down Fernando reveals himself
to Ninette&mdash;a happy satire upon a familiar melodramatic
<span class="nwrp">situation:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Turning to the burlesques of opera of the German school,
we begin, naturally, with Mozart, whose "Don Giovanni"
found humorous reflection in two pieces, by H. J. Byron
and Mr. Reece. The former's "Little Don Giovanni"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
belongs to 1865, when it was performed at the Prince of
Wales's, with Miss Wilton (Mrs. Bancroft) as the hero,
Clarke as Leporello, Miss Fanny Josephs as Masetto, Mr.
Hare as Zerlina (probably his only appearance on the stage
in petticoats), Miss Sophie Larkin as Elvira, and Miss
Hughes as Donna Anna. Don Giovanni was the last
burlesque part written by Byron for Miss Wilton, and,
moreover, it was the last burlesque part she ever played.
She records in her Memoirs that an amusing feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
piece was the spectacle presented in the last act by the
Commandant's horse, which, in allusion to a recent freak
in Leicester Square, had been covered with a variety of
spots, and "looked like an exaggerated Lowther Arcade
toy." Mr. Reece's burlesque was called "Don Giovanni
in Venice," and came out at the Gaiety in 1873.</p>

<p>In 1842 Macready revived at Drury Lane Handel's
delightful "Acis and Galatea," and the opera was promptly
caricatured by W. H. Oxberry in a piece produced three
days afterwards at the Adelphi. The travestie of "Acis
and Galatea" which was seen at the Olympic in 1863
was from the pen of Mr. Burnand. Its full title was
"Acis and Galatea, or the Nimble Nymph and the Terrible
Troglodyte"; and the Nimble Nymph (described as "a
Nymph of the Sea, who also visits the land&mdash;a nymphibious
young lady") was played by Miss Hughes. The puns
were prolific, and so were the parodies, the best of which
are written in caricature of the absurd English translations
in the operatic "books of the play." Here, for example, is
a setting of the trio in "Trovatore"&mdash;"Il tuo <span class="nwrp">sangue":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Polyphemus.</i> With you, oh, sanguine, I'd share your 'art, oh!<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Six years after the production of Mr. Burnand's piece,
Mr. T. F. Plowman brought out at Oxford "a piece of
extravagance," to which he gave the name of "A Very New
Edition of Acis and Galatea, or the Beau! the Belle! and
the Blacksmith!"</p>

<p>Of Meyerbeer's operas three have been burlesqued in
England&mdash;"Dinorah," "L'Africaine" and "Robert le
Diable." The first of these was parodied in "Dinorah
under Difficulties," a burlesque by William Brough, which
dates back as far as 1859 (at the Adelphi). "L'Africaine"
was handled by Mr. Burnand six years later at the Strand.
Three years more, and "Robert le Diable" was being
travestied at the Gaiety by Mr. Gilbert, under the title
of "Robert the Devil, or the Nun, the Dun, and the Sun of
a Gun."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This last is on the old lines of "palmy-day"
burlesque, and has not much in it that is characteristically
Gilbertian. The lyrics are written chiefly to operatic airs,
and there is no room, therefore, for rhythmical invention.
In the dialogue, however, one comes across an occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
passage which strikes one as quite Gilbertian in its cynicism.
Take, for example, these lines from the scene in which
fun is made of the Tussaud "Chamber of <span class="nwrp">Horrors":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bertram.</i> These are all statues, raised from time to time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To people who're remarkable for crime.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Robert.</i> But if their wicked deeds could so unnerve one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why give them statues?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bert.</i><span class="indent5">'Cause they don't deserve one.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's our strict rule&mdash;a rule we never garble&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good deeds we write in sand, bad deeds in marble.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the puns in the piece are worth recording.
Thus, Alice says of a porter, to whom half a crown has
been <span class="nwrp">given:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He'll spend it all upon his favourite wets&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tipsy gets with all the <em>tips he gets</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, Gobetto says of <span class="nwrp">Robert:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He's smoking to a pretty tune, I'll bet, oh!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Prince.</i> That pretty tune must be "Il Cigaretto."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gobetto says to <span class="nwrp">Robert:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We saw you through the window, pouring fizz in!<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Alice.</i> Why, Robert, how you've changed in speech and tone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your forehead, once so smooth, now bears a frown on it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for your mouth, 'tis evident you're down in it!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Robert.</i> Yes, though I'm young, it's plain to all who con it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down <em>in</em> the mouth before I've down <em>upon</em> it!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Weber's "Der Freischutz" has been travestied both by
Mr. Burnand and by H. J. Byron, both productions taking
place in 1866, within two days of each other&mdash;the one at
the Strand, and the other at the Prince of Wales's. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Reece is responsible for a burlesque of Flotow's "Martha,"
performed at the Gaiety in 1873, with Miss Constance
Loseby, Miss Rachel Sanger, Mr. Lionel Brough, and
Mr. Aynsley Cook in the leading parts.</p>

<p>Wagnerian "music-drama" has more than once been
desecrated on the burlesque stage. First of all there
came, at the Royalty in 1869, the "Flying Dutchman" of
William Brough; then Messrs. Green and Swanborough
brought out at the Strand, in 1876, "The Flying Dutchman"
(with M. Marius and Miss Lottie Venne); and the
"Little Lohengrin" of Mr. Bowyer saw the light in 1884
at the Holborn Theatre.</p>

<p>So much for the German school. Of the French composers,
Auber has had more pieces travestied in this country
than has any one of his fellows. There is "Masaniello," for
instance, and "Fra Diavolo," and "Les Diamans de la
Couronne." "Masaniello, or the Fish 'oman of Naples,"
was the title given by Robert B. Brough to the "fish tale,
in one act," which he wrote for the Olympic in 1857.
He had, for the impersonator of his hero, Robson, whose
presence in the cast suggested to Mrs. Wigan the addition
to the mad scene of sundry indications of the actor's former
successes at the Olympic. The result was very successful.
Masaniello came on, crying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My lord, the Earl of Hammersmith is taken!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stop! That's in <cite>Hamlet</cite>! I'm Masaniello!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be or not to was&mdash;that's in <cite>Othello</cite>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Translated into Irish&mdash;for Ristori.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pop goes the Weasel&mdash;that's from <cite>Trovatore</cite>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then breaks off into a portion of the dagger dance from
"Macbeth Travestie," following this up with a scrap from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Italian opera and part of the hornpipe in "The Yellow
Dwarf." Then Borella <span class="nwrp">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

<p>Then followed a song, in parody of "I'm <span class="nwrp">Afloat":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>After this, Robson was wont to introduce a bit of
"business" from "The Discreet Princess," ending with a
ditty from the "Medea" burlesque. The travestie of the
pantomime-action of the dumb girl Fenella was naturally
another feature of Brough's work, which had the usual
supply of puns, and, altogether, more than the usual amount
of literary and dramatic merit. The little travestie, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
"Masse-en-Yell-Oh," written by Messrs. Harry Paulton and
Mostyn Tedde for the Comedy in 1886, was an unpretending
piece of work, not challenging comparison with its
predecessor.</p>

<p>Auber's "Fra Diavolo" was another of the operatic originals
on which H. J. Byron based his comic fancies. He wrote,
to begin with, "Fra Diavolo, or the Beauty and the Brigands,"
first seen at the Strand in 1858; and then, twenty years
after, "Young Fra Diavolo," which made its appearance
at the Gaiety. "Les Diamans de la Couronne" fell to the
lot of Mr. Reece, who, in 1875, prepared for the Holborn
Theatre the piece entitled "The Half-crown Diamonds,"
a revised edition of which found its way to the stage of the
Imperial Theatre just five years later.</p>

<p>Hérold's "Zampa" was burlesqued by Mr. T. F. Plowman
at the Court in 1872, and by Mr. J. McArdle for the
provincial stage in 1876. The "Mignon" of M. Thomas
has also been transmogrified into the "Merry Mignon"
of Mr. Wilton Jones (1882). The "Carmen" of Georges
Bizet has had its mirthful side portrayed in no fewer than
four comic pieces&mdash;the "Carmen, or Sold for a Song"
of Mr. Reece (Folly, 1879); the "Cruel Carmen" of
Mr. Wilton Jones (1880); the "Little Carmen" of Mr.
Alfred Murray (Globe, 1884); and the "Carmen Up to
Data" of Messrs. Sims and Pettitt (Gaiety, 1890). The
Carmen of the first of these productions was Miss Lydia
Thompson,&mdash;of the last, Miss Florence St. John, a charming
vocalist, gifted with the true <i lang="la">vis comica</i>.</p>

<p>But the most popular, by a long way, of all French
operas, for purposes of burlesque, has been the "Faust"
of Gounod. Of the many travesties of this, or of the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
embodied in it, the earliest was that of Halford, brought
out at the Olympic in 1854. This was followed in 1857 by
a piece called "Alonzo the Brave," written by Mr. Burnand
for performance by University amateurs at Cambridge, and
mingling the story of Alonzo, as told in the ballad, with that
of Faust, in a fashion effective, if a little puzzling. In this
piece of extravagance (in which, by the way, Mr. Burnand
played Mephistopheles), Imogene is the heroine, taking
the place of Marguerite in the affections of Faust. For a
while, in the absence of Alonzo, she yields to the snares
of the tempter; but, in the end, her first sweetheart
appears to her as his own ghost, her inconstancy is forgiven,
and Faust retires from the scene.</p>

<p>Seven years later Mr. Burnand wrote a burlesque called
"Faust and Marguerite" for the St. James's. He had Ashley
for his Faust, Charles Mathews and Mrs. Charles Mathews
for his Mephistopheles and Marguerite, H. J. Montague for
his Valentine, and "Johnny" Clarke for his Martha. In this
instance he followed the story of the opera pretty closely
till near the end, when Faust was sued for breach of promise
of marriage, and escaped the clutches of Mephistopheles
only by consenting to pair off with Martha! A visit to a
music-hall formed part of the action, and gave occasion for
some pointed lines. Said <span class="nwrp">Faust:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm saddened by your modern comic singing;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and Mephistopheles went on to describe the <span class="nwrp">scene:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There sat the draper's clerk, who wildly loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tenth-rate <i lang="it">prima donna</i> in cleaned gloves;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And encores everything and everybody.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The minnow is the <em>minnow</em>-mum of fishes.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To make herself <em>primmer</em> and to <em>don her</em> dress.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In 1869 Mr. Burnand was to the fore again with "Very
Little Faust and More Marguerite," which was played at
the Charing Cross Theatre (as the building was then
called). A few years later&mdash;in 1877&mdash;H. J. Byron entered
the field with "Little Doctor Faust," in which he had for
interpreters the Gaiety artists, headed by Miss Farren and
Mr. Edward Terry. Later still&mdash;in 1885&mdash;came a provincial
writer with "Faust in Forty Minutes." In 1886 we
had at the Royalty a piece called "Mephisto," of which the
only characteristic feature was an imitation of Mr. Irving
by Mr. E. J. Henley, clever in its way, but not to be
compared for sustained truthfulness to the performance
given by Mr. H. E. Dixey in "Adonis" (at the Gaiety) a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
week or two previously. In 1886, also, Mr. Burnand
brought out at Toole's&mdash;with Mr. Toole as Mephistopheles
(<i>à la</i> Irving)&mdash;"Faust and Loose"; and, two years after,
we had at the Gaiety the "Faust up to Date" of Messrs.
G. R. Sims and Henry Pettitt, of which more hereafter. A
notable fact about "Faust and Loose" is the appearance on
the stage, for the first time, of Marguerite's mother&mdash;a lady
unaccountably neglected by all previous writers, serious
or otherwise! In the burlesque she thus introduces
<span class="nwrp">herself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>English serious opera has not often fallen a prey to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
untender mercies of the parodist. Balfe and Vincent
Wallace alone have been victimised in that way&mdash;Balfe
through his "Bohemian Girl" and "Rose of Castile";
Wallace through his "Maritana." The "Bohemian Girl"
has taken four different shapes on the burlesque boards.
In 1851, as transmogrified by the Brothers Brough, she
figured at the Haymarket as "Arline." In 1864, under the
auspices of Messrs. Best and Bellingham, she appeared
at Sadler's Wells under the same designation. At the
command of Mr. W. S. Gilbert she posed at the Royalty
in 1868 as "The Merry Zingara." In 1877, as portrayed
by H. J. Byron at the Opéra Comique and Gaiety, she
appeared as "The Bohemian Gy-url." For his Arline Mr.
Gilbert had Miss "Patty" Oliver; for his Gipsy Queen,
Miss Charlotte Saunders; for his Count Arnheim, Fred
Dewar; and for his Devilshoof, Danvers. Byron's piece
was interpreted by the Gaiety Company. "The Rose of
Castile," as treated by Mr. Conway Edwardes, was seen in
1872 at the Brighton Theatre as "The Rows of Castile."
"Maritana," of course, was the origin and basis of Mr.
Burnand's "Mary Turner" (Holborn Theatre, 1867), as
well as of Byron's "Little Don Cæsar de Bazan" (Gaiety,
1876), in which Mr. Terry was such an entertaining King
Charles.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BURLESQUE OF FICTION AND SONG.</p>


<p>The writers of stage travestie have gone less to fiction
for subject-matter than might have been expected.
Half a dozen romances previous to Scott, half a dozen of
Scott's own stories, about the same number of modern
novels, and still fewer foreign masterpieces&mdash;these represent
the sources of all the most important of the burlesques
which have been based upon invented prose narrative.</p>

<p>The earliest of the tales which have been thus dealt with
is "Robinson Crusoe." Of this time-honoured story, the
first whimsical treatment was that which took the shape of
a piece called "Crusoe the Second, or the Shipwrecked
Milliners," presented at the Lyceum in 1847. This was
written by Stocqueler, and had for interpreters Mr. and
Mrs. Keeley, with Alfred Wigan (as Crusoe). It was followed,
in 1860, at the Princess's, by the "Robinson Crusoe"
of H. J. Byron. Seven years later, no fewer than six
writers joined in the production of a perversion of Defoe's
tale, brought out at the Haymarket in 1867, and bearing the
names of H. J. Byron, W. S. Gilbert, T. Hood, jun., H. S.
Leigh, W. J. Prowse, and Arthur Sketchley. In this (which
was given at a <i>matinée</i> for the benefit of the family of Paul
Gray, the artist) the parts were all sustained by well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
men of art and letters. After this there came, in 1876, at
the Folly, the "Robinson Crusoe" of Mr. H. B. Farnie,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
which, in its turn, was followed, just ten years later, by yet
another arrangement of the story, in which Mr. Farnie had
the co-operation of Mr. Reece.</p>

<p>To the Adelphi, in 1846, belongs an "extra extravagant
extravaganza," founded by Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett and
Mark Lemon on the "Peter Wilkins" of Robert Paltock
(first printed in 1750). This burlesque had for its full title&mdash;"Peter
Wilkins, or the Loadstone Rock and the Flying
Indians," and had for its chief interpreters&mdash;Miss Woolgar
as the hero, Paul Bedford as Jack Adams, and Miss E.
Chaplin as Youriwkee. Dr. Johnson's "Rasselas" attracted
the attention of William Brough, and was made, in 1862,
the foundation of a burlesque produced at the Haymarket.</p>

<p>In 1765 Horace Walpole published his mediæval imagining,
"The Castle of Otranto," by which so many of us have
in our youth been thrilled. In 1848 Gilbert Abbott a'Beckett
set himself to make fun of its singularities, and the result
was a very brightly written piece, enacted at the Haymarket.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
In this, Manfred's son Conrad is found imprisoned under
the gigantic helmet of Alphonso, and the distracted father
at once begins to give way to comic <span class="nwrp">word-splitting:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">But stay!&mdash;has anybody got a lever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give a lift to this gigantic beaver?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i class="stage-direction">The helmet is raised at the back; Manfred looks under it.</i>)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! he speaks the truth&mdash;my son lies low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor little chap, under this great <em>chapeau</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My. Conrad gone!&mdash;This is a sad disaster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The die is cast by this unlucky castor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can no one tell me how or whence it came?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there no ticket with the hatter's name?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I knew grief before, this hat has capped it,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My boy, crush'd 'neath this hated nap, has napped it!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the opening scene, Hippolita, Conrad's mother, ventures
to suggest to Manfred that the boy is not of marriageable
age, sixteen summers not having yet passed o'er his
<span class="nwrp">head:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Man.</i> Time flies, you know; thro' life one quickly flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One's sixteen summersets, after sixteen springs.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The boy's as downy as a boy need be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the year following the publication of "The Castle of
Otranto," the "Vicar of Wakefield" was given to the world.
It appears to have escaped travestie until 1885, when&mdash;thinking
more, no doubt, of Mr. Wills's "Olivia" than of
Goldsmith's <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>&mdash;Messrs. Stephens and Yardley
brought out at the Gaiety "The Vicar of Wideawakefield,"
in which Mr. Arthur Roberts and Miss Laura Linden sought,
not unsuccessfully, to reproduce and heighten some of the
artistic peculiarities of Mr. Irving and Miss Ellen Terry.
Mrs. Shelley's "Frankenstein," published in 1818, received
its first dramatic <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> in 1849, when the
Brothers Brough made it the subject of a burlesque;&mdash;its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
second in 1887, when Messrs. "Richard Henry" turned out
at the Gaiety a travestie, of which I shall have something
to say in my next chapter. In the Broughs' version Wright
was Frankenstein and Paul Bedford the Monster, and much
fun was made out of the finishing touches which Frankenstein
gave to his work. "O." Smith, Miss Woolgar, and
Miss Chaplin were also in the cast.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott's novels have obtained a fair amount of
notice from the comic dramatists. "Ivanhoe," for example,
has exercised the humorous powers of three&mdash;of Robert
Brough (at the Haymarket in 1850), of H. J. Byron (at the
Strand in 1862), and of T. F. Plowman (at the Court in 1871).
Byron (who called his work "Ivanhoe in accordance with
the Spirit of the Times"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>) had the aid of Miss Charlotte
Saunders as his Wilfred, of Charles Rice as his Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, of "Johnny" Clarke as his Isaac of York, of
Miss Eleanor Bufton as his Black Knight, of Miss Swanborough
as Rowena, of Jenny Rogers as his Rebecca, and
of Miss Polly Marshall, Miss Fanny Hughes, and Poynter
in other parts. In the provinces he was his own Isaac of
York.</p>

<p>"Isaac of York," by the way, was the title given by
Mr. Plowman to his effort, which had a good deal of
ingenuity and "go." Here, for example, is an extract from
the scene at the banquet at which Cedric entertains his
guests. Ivanhoe is soliloquising aside, and his utterances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>

<p>Next to "Ivanhoe" in popularity for travestie we may
place "Rob Roy." Mr. Sydney French took it in hand at
the Marylebone in 1867, and Mr. William Lowe gave it
a very Scotch rendering, in 1880, under the title of "Mr.
Robert Roye, Hielan Helen his Wife, and Dougal the
Dodger." But the "standard" burlesque on the subject is,
of course, Mr. Burnand's "Robbing Roy" (Gaiety, 1879),
in which Mr. Terry was such a diverting "Roy," with
Miss Farren as Francis, Miss Vaughan as Diana, and Mr.
Royce as an admirable Dougal. Of the "Bride of Lammermoor"
there have been two burlesque versions&mdash;Oxberry's,
at the Strand in 1848; and H. J. Byron's, at the Prince
of Wales's in 1865. "Kenilworth" has been similarly
honoured. There was the piece brought out at the Strand
in 1858 by Andrew Halliday and a collaborator, and there
was that which Messrs. Reece and Farnie contributed
to the Avenue Theatre in 1885. "Guy Mannering" has
engaged the attention of Mr. Burnand: we can all remember
his "Here's another Guy Mannering," brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
out at the Vaudeville in 1874. For the solitary travestie of
"The Talisman," the late J. F. M'Ardle is responsible. It
was first played at Liverpool in the year last named.</p>

<p>Lord Lytton's novels and romances have been ridiculed
on the stage very much less frequently than have his
dramas. "The Very Last Days of Pompeii," by Mr. Reece,
and "The Last of the Barons," by Mr. Du Terreaux, are,
so far as I know, the only stage works in which his prose
fiction has been perverted. The former was seen at the
Vaudeville in 1872, and the latter at the Strand in the same
year. In "The Last of the Barons," Atkins was the Kingmaker,
Mr. Edward Terry portraying Edward IV. as a
great dandy, and endowing him with an amusing lisp.</p>

<p>When we turn to the stories of more recent times,
we think at once of the "No Thoroughfare" of Charles
Dickens and Wilkie Collins, and of the "Foul Play" of
Charles Reade and Dion Boucicault, as having suffered at
the hands of the irreverent scribes. The former romance
suggested to Hazlewood junior his "No Thorough-fair
beyond Highbury, or the Maid, the Mother, and the
Malicious Mountaineer." This was in 1868; and in the
following year the elder George Grossmith emulated Hazlewood's
example at the Victoria Theatre. "Foul Play"
was parodied by Mr. Burnand, not only in the pages of
<cite>Punch</cite>, but in "Fowl Play, or a Story of Chikkin Hazard,"
produced at the New Queers in 1868.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Of the bright

<p>Among other recent fictions which have obtained the
distinction of stage travestie may be named "Lady Audley's
Secret," "Little Lord Fauntleroy," and "The Strange Case
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." In the first of these instances
H. J. Byron was the operator&mdash;the scene, the St. James's
Theatre in 1863. Mrs. Burnett's pretty conception was
tortured into "The Other Little Lord Fondleboy" (1888),
and Mr. Stevenson's weird invention into "The Real
Case of Hide and Seekyll" (Royalty, 1888), for which the
younger George Grossmith must bear the blame.</p>

<p>The literature of dramatic parody does not owe much
to foreign fiction. Farnie gave us "Little Gil Bias" at
the Princess's in 1870, and in the same year Mr. Arthur
Wood produced at the Olympic a comic paraphrase of
"Paul and Virginia." It was in 1870, too, that Messrs.
Eldred and Paulton turned out, at Liverpool, "The Gay
Musketeers," which was followed at the Strand in 1871 by
"The Three Musket-Dears" of Messrs. J. and H. Paulton.
Of the "Monte Cristo Junior" of Messrs. "Richard Henry"
I shall have something to say anon.</p>

<p>Dividing Song for the moment into Poem and Ballad, we
note that the poems of Lord Byron have been the inspiring
cause of at least four notable burlesques. His lordship's
"Don Juan" suggested the "Beautiful Haidee" of
H. J. Byron (1863) and the "Don Juan Junior" of the
"Brothers Prendergast" (1880); while his "Corsair" is the
basis of William Brough's "Conrad and Medora" (Lyceum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
1856), and his "Bride of Abydos" prompted the piece with
the same title which H. J. Byron wrote for the Strand
Theatre. In "Conrad and Medora" Miss Marie Wilton
was "the Little Fairy at the Bottom of the Sea," the title-parts
being given to Miss Woolgar and Mrs. Charles Dillon,
and that of Birbanto to Mr. Toole. The Bride of Abydos&mdash;Zuleika&mdash;had
Miss Oliver for her representative.</p>

<p>With Byron it seems natural to associate his friend Tom
Moore, whose "Lalla Rookh" has had exceptional favour
with the parodists. Four of these have been fascinated by
her charms&mdash;Mr. J. T. Denny in 1885, Mr. Horace Lennard
in the previous year, Vincent Amcotts in 1866, and last,
but not least, William Brough (at the Lyceum) in 1857. It
was to be expected that, when travestying Moore, Brough
should parody "The Minstrel Boy," and so we have from
him the following lines, sung by Miss Woolgar as
<span class="nwrp">Feramorz:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The minstrel boy through the town is known,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Straw laid down!" cries the minstrel boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Some sick man here needs quiet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bobbin' around' will this house annoy,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The minstrel grinds, and his victims pay;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To his claims he's forced compliance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the poet's study then he takes his way&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the men of art and science.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cries, "My friends, in vain you'd toil<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At books, at pen, or easel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One roving vagabond your work shall spoil,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He plays "Pop goes the Weasel."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>Elsewhere, Namouna, the Peri, gave utterance to the
following reflections on the levelling power of <span class="nwrp">love<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love makes all equal&mdash;scorns of rank the rules;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes kings and beggars equal&mdash;equal fools.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Love makes the housemaid careless&mdash;masters wroth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes too many cooks to spoil their broth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this piece Mrs. Charles Dillon was the Lalla Rookh, and
Mr. Toole represented "a fabulous personage, not found in
the poem," called Khorsanbad.</p>

<p>One, at least, of our burlesque writers&mdash;Mr. Gilbert
Arthur a'Beckett&mdash;has had the courage to tackle a poem
of Coleridge; to wit, his "Christabel," from which, however,
Mr. A'Beckett derived only certain suggestions for
his work. In his "Christabel, or the Bard Bewitched,"
represented at the Court in 1872, the Bard, Bracy, was
played by Mr. Righton, who made a special feature of a
travestie of Mr. Irving in "The Bells." He pretended
that he had murdered a muffin-man, and that, consuming
all he could of the muffins left in the man's basket, he
had deposited the remainder in the area. Miss Nelly
Bromley was the Christabel.</p>

<p>Scott's "Lady of the Lake" gave Mr. Reece the idea
for a burlesque performed at the Royalty in 1866. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
same year Andrew Halliday brought out at the Adelphi a
comic piece, happily entitled "The Mountain Dhu, or
the Knight, the Lady, and the Lake." Mr. Toole was the
impersonator of the Mountain Dhu, Paul Bedford the
Douglas, Miss Hughes the Malcolm Graeme, Miss Woolgar
(Mrs. Mellon) the Fitzjames, and Miss Furtado the Lady
of the Lake. "The Lady of the Lane" was the title given
by H. J. Byron to the travestie from his pen which saw
the light at the Strand in 1872. In this case Mr. Edward
Terry was the Roderick and Miss Kate Bishop the Ellen,
Mrs. Raymond making a great hit as the demented Blanche.</p>

<p>Our present Laureate provoked in 1870 the satiric powers
of Mr. W. S. Gilbert, whose "Princess," played at the
Olympic, was described by the author as "a whimsical
allegory," as well as "a respectful perversion of Mr.
Tennyson's poem."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In this production Mr. Gilbert
wrote his lyrics to the melodies of popular airs, after the
manner of the time. The major portion of the travestie
is familiar to present-day audiences as having formed, in
the main, the text of "Princess Ida," for which Sir Arthur
Sullivan composed such charming music. Nevertheless, I
cannot refrain from quoting, as a happy specimen of Mr.
Gilbert's later manner in burlesque,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the speech addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
by the Princess to her disciples&mdash;a speech marked by
agreeable <i>naïvétè</i> and happy <span class="nwrp">mock-heroics:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Into the region of the Ballad the comic playwrights have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
made comparatively few incursions. "The Babes in the
Wood," "Lord Bateman," "Billy Taylor," "Villikins and
his Dinah," and "Lord Lovel,"&mdash;these are the stories
which have been most in favour with burlesque purveyors.
R. J. Byron took up the first-named subject in 1859, when
the company at the Adelphi (where the piece was produced)
included Miss Woolgar (Sir Rowland Macassar), Mr. Toole
and Miss Kate Kelly (the Babes), Paul Bedford (the First
Ruffian), and Mrs. Billington (the Lady Macassar). Then,
in 1877, there came a provincial version by Messrs. G. L.
Gordon and G. W. Anson; and, next, in 1884, at Toole's
Theatre, the "Babes" of Mr. Harry Paulton, in which
Mr. Edouin and Miss Atherton were the central figures.
The first travestie of "Lord Bateman" was made by
Charles Selby at the Strand in 1839; then there was the
production by R. B. Brough in 1854 at the Adelphi; and,
still later, there was the piece by H. J. Byron, at the Globe
(1869). Passing over the "Billy Taylor" of Buckstone (1829),
we arrive at "The Military Billy Taylor" of Mr. Burnand,
which came out forty years later. It is to Mr. Burnand,
also, that we owe "Villikins and his Dinah," played by
amateurs at Cambridge, as well as "Lord Lovel and the
Lady Nancy Bell," which he wrote for the same place and
performers.</p>

<p class="center">THE NEW BURLESQUE.</p>


<p>With the year 1885 there dawned a new epoch for
stage travestie in England. The old Gaiety company
had broken up, Miss Farren alone remaining; and with
the accession of fresh blood there came fresh methods.
The manager who had succeeded Mr. Hollingshead recognised
the tendencies of the times; and with "Little Jack
Sheppard"&mdash;a travestie by Messrs. Stephens and Yardley
of the well-known story, familiar both in fiction and in
drama&mdash;a novel departure was made.</p>

<p>In the "palmy" days, burlesque had not, as a rule,
formed the whole of an evening's entertainment. The one-act
travestie had grown on occasion into two and even three
acts; but, until recent years, the one act (in several scenes)
had usually been deemed sufficient, the remainder of the
programme being devoted to comedy or drama. The
musical part of the performance had generally been made
up of adaptations or reproductions of popular airs of the
day&mdash;either comic songs or operatic melodies: very rarely
had the music been special and original. The scenery had
never been particularly remarkable; nor, save during the
various <i>régimes</i> of Vestris, had there been any special splen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>dour
in the dresses. For the most part, the old school of
burlesque did not rely upon a brilliant <i>mise-en-scène</i>. In the
prologue to his "Alcestis," produced just forty-one years
ago, we find Talfourd expressly drawing attention to the
simplicity of the stage show. Speaking of the productions
at the houses of serious drama, he <span class="nwrp">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Plays of the greatest and the least pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are mounted so regardless of expense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fifty nights is scarce a run accounted&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run! They should gallop, being so well <em>mounted</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But with "Alcestis" it was to be <span class="nwrp">different:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What you enjoy must be all "on the quiet."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No horse will pull <em>our</em> play up if it drag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No banners when our wit is on the flag;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No great effects or new-imported dance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drooping eye will waken and entrance; ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an old story from a classic clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done for the period into modern rhyme.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very different policy was to characterise the New
Burlesque. The pieces, having now become the staple of
the night's amusement, were to be placed upon the boards
with all possible splendour. Money was to be spent
lavishly on scenery, properties and costumes. Dancing was
to be a prominent feature&mdash;not the good old-fashioned
"breakdowns" and the like, but choreographic interludes
of real grace and ingenuity. The music was to be
written specially for the productions, and pains were
to be taken to secure artists who could really sing.
Something had already been done in each of these directions.
So long ago as 1865 Mr. Burnand's "Windsor
Forest" had been fitted with wholly new music; and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the Gaiety, under Mr. Hollingshead, burlesque had grown
in elaborateness year by year. Not, however, till the
production of "Little Jack Sheppard," in 1885, had the
elaboration been so marked and complete in all departments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how were the librettists to be affected?
Clearly, they would have to give more opportunities than
usual for musical and saltatory illustration; and accordingly
we find the book of "Little Jack Sheppard" full of lyrics&mdash;solos,
duets, quartets and choruses, all of them set to
new airs by competent composers. At the same time, the
authors took care not to omit the element of punning
dialogue. In this respect the old traditions were to be
maintained. Byron, for instance, might very well have
written the lines which follow, in which the interlocutors
strive to outdo one another in the recklessness of their <i>jeux
de</i> <span class="nwrp"><i>mots</i>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Little Jack Sheppard"&mdash;which had for its chief exponents
Miss Farren, Mr. Fred Leslie (a brilliant recruit
from the comic opera stage), Mr. David James (who had
returned for a time to his old love), Mr. Odell, Miss Harriet
Coveney, and Miss Marion Hood (who had graduated
in Gilbert-Sullivan opera)&mdash;was followed at the Gaiety
by "Monte Cristo Junior," in which Messrs. "Richard
Henry" presented a bright and vivacious travestie of
Dumas' famous fiction, greatly aided by the <i>chic</i> of Miss
Farren as the hero, and the inexhaustible humorous

<p>After "Monte Cristo Junior" there came, at the same
theatre and from the pens of the same writers, a travestie of
"Frankenstein," produced in 1887, with Miss Farren as
the hero, and Mr. Leslie as the Monster that he fashions.
Here much ingenuity was shown in the management of the
pseudo-supernatural business connected with the Monster.
Previous to the vivifying of the figure, Frankenstein thus
<span class="nwrp">soliloquised:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1888 Mr. G. R. Sims and Mr. Henry Pettitt joined
forces in burlesque, and the result was seen in a piece happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
entitled "Faust up to Date." In this version Marguerite
(Miss Florence St. John) figures first as a barmaid at an
Exhibition. She is a young lady of some astuteness, though
she insists upon her general <span class="nwrp">ingenuousness:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">I'm a simple little maid,<br /></span>

<span class="i18">I never go to balls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And my venerated mother always knows when I am out.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">When I leave my work at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">I never think it right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk to any gentleman I haven't seen before.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">But I take a 'bus or tram,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For I know that my big brother will be waiting at the door.<br /></span>

<p>Martha introduces herself <span class="nwrp">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>When Valentine returns home and hears the scandal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
about his sister, he breaks out into the following terrific
<span class="nwrp">curse:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When to the drawing-room you have to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms all bare and neck extremely low,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whene'er you ride, or drive a prancing pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May the steam roller meet you everywhere!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thro' the Park you wend your homeward way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, may it be a Home Rule gala day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When for a concert you have paid your gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May Mr. Sims Reeves have a dreadful cold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May you live where, through lath-and-plaster walls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your husband's mother, when you are a wife,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>At the end, when Mephistopheles (Mr. E. J. Lonnen)
comes to claim Faust, it turns out that Faust and Marguerite
have been duly married, but have been obliged to conceal
the fact because Marguerite was a ward in Chancery.
Moreover, Old Faust reappears, and insists that, as it was
he who signed the bond, it is he and not young Faust who
ought to suffer for it.</p>

<p>"Faust up to Date" includes some clever songs and
some excruciating puns, of which these are perhaps the
most <span class="nwrp">excruciating:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Marg.</i> These sapphires are the finest I have seen.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This one I opal not do that for me.<br /></span>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Mephis.</i> Along the Riviera, dudes her praises sing.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Val.</i> Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>"Atalanta," the travestie by Mr. G. P. Hawtrey brought
out at the Strand in 1888, was fitted with prose dialogue,
much of which was very smart and amusing. The songs
were numerous and well-turned, and certain details of the
travestie were ingenious. Hippomenes, the hero, wins the
race he runs with Atalanta, by placing in her path a brand-new
"costume," of modern cut and material, which she
finds it impossible not to stop for. For the rest, while
possessing a decidedly "classical" flavour, "Atalanta" was,
in essence, a racing burlesque, abounding in the phraseology
of the turf, and introducing in the last scene counterfeit
presentments of a number of well-known sportsmen.</p>

<p>An agreeable cynicism ran through both the talk and the
lyrics, from one of which&mdash;a duet between King Sch&oelig;neus
and his High Chamberlain, Lysimachus&mdash;I extract the
following satire on turf <span class="nwrp"><i>morale</i>:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> There's a time to win and a time to lose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i><span class="indent4">Of course, of course, of course.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> You can make 'em safe whenever you choose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i><span class="indent4"> By force, by force, by force.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> Then doesn't it seem a sin and a shame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To stop such a pleasant and easy game?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If a horse doesn't win, why, who is to blame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i> <span class="indent4">The horse, the horse, the horse.</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> If it's cleverly managed, I always think&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i><span class="indent4">Proceed, proceed, proceed&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> At a neat little swindle it's proper to wink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i><span class="indent4">Indeed, indeed, indeed!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">I don't understand what it's all about;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But a man must be punished, I have no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If he's such a fool as to get found out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i><span class="indent4">Agreed, agreed, agreed.</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> It's all because jockeys have played such tricks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i><span class="indent4">They go too far, too far.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lys.</i> That the stewards are down like a thousand of bricks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sch.</i> <span class="indent4">They are, they are, they are.</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a season or two, you'll observe with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They'll hunt out abuses with might and main;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then the good old times will come back again.<br /></span>
<span class="i17">Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elsewhere, there is a diverting bit of parody suggested
by the extreme cautiousness and bad grammar of some
newspaper racing prophecies. Hippomenes and Atalanta
are the sole competitors in the race, and the local "tipster"
thus discusses their <span class="nwrp">prospects:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have from time to time gone through the chances of the several
competitors, so that to repeat what I have written is to go over very
well-worn ground. Although the race is reduced to a match, it has lost
none of its interest in the eyes of the public. It is a difficult race to
meddle with, but the plunge must be made; I shall, therefore, give my
vote to Atalanta, which, if beaten, it may be by Hippomenes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of "Joan of Arc," the "operatic burlesque" written by
Messrs. J. L. Shine and "Adrian Ross" to music by Mr.
Osmond Carr (Opéra Comique, 1891), the distinguishing
feature&mdash;apart from the fact that the music is all original
and all the work of one composer&mdash;is the neatness of
the lyric writing, with which special pains appear to have
been taken. Of Joan herself her father is made to sing as
<span class="nwrp">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, there's nobody adepter<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She can do Salvation sulphur<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hot and hot, hot, hot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She can play the drum and cymbal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her fingers she is nimble,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Of all the songs in the piece, however, perhaps the most
vivacious is that in which De Richemont (Mr. Arthur
Roberts) describes how he "went to find <span class="nwrp">Emin":&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, I went to find Emin Pasha, and started away for fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a box of weeds and a bag of beads, some tracts and a Maxim gun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friends all said I should come back dead, but I didn't care a pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I ran up a bill and I made my will, and I went to find Emin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went to find Emin, I did, I looked for him far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found him right, I found him tight, and a lot of folks beside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away through Darkest Africa, though it cost me lots of tin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For without a doubt I'd find him out, when I went to find Emin!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I turned my face to a savage place, that is called Boulogne-sur-Mer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the natives go on <i>petits chevaux</i> and the gay <i>chemin de fer</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the girls of the tribe I won't describe, for I'm rather a modest man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are poor, I suppose, for they're short of clothes, when they take what they call <i>les bains</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they said to me, "<i>Oh, sapristi!</i>" and the men remarked, "<i>Sacré!</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>vive la guerre aux pommes de terre</i>, and <i>vingt minutes d'arrêt</i>!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Voulez-vous du b&oelig;uf? j'ai huit! j'ai neuf!</i> till they deafened me with their din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I <i>parlez</i>'d <i>bon soir</i> and said <i>au revoir</i>, for I had to find Emin!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<hr class="tb" /><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And at last I found Emin, poor chap, in the midst of the nigger bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who daily prowl, with horrible howl, along the Margate sands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the tones of the rattling bones, and I hurried down to the beach&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well I know that they will not go till you give them sixpence each!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said they, "Uncle Ned, oh! he berry dead, and de banjo out ob tune!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But I took that band to the edge of the sand, and there I dropped 'Emin!<br /></span>

<p>I have not thought it necessary, in the preceding pages,
to offer any apology for stage burlesque. One must regret
that it sometimes lacks refinement in word and action,
and that in the matter of costume it is not invariably
decorous; but that we shall always have it with us, in some
form or other, may be accepted as incontrovertible. So long
as there is anything extravagant in literature or manners&mdash;in
the way either of simplicity or of any other quality&mdash;so
long will travestie find both food and scope. That is the
<i>raison d'être</i> of theatrical burlesque&mdash;that it shall satirise
the exaggerated and the extreme. It does not wage war
against the judicious and the moderate. As H. J. Byron
once wrote of his own <span class="nwrp">craft:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though some may scout it, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burlesque is like the winnowing machine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It simply blows away the husks, you know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goodly corn is not moved by the blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What arrant rubbish of the clap-trap school<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has vanished&mdash;thanks to pungent ridicule!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What stock stage-customs, nigh to bursting goaded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With so much "blowing up" have been exploded!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had our light writers done no more than this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their doggrel efforts scarce had been amiss.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>In this defence of his calling, Byron had been anticipated
by Planché, who, in one of his occasional pieces, introduced

<p class="center"><small>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</small>.</p>


<p><small>"If it is well to judge by firstfruits (and, generally speaking, the judgment
is right), the new 'Whitefriars Library' should compass the very laudable
designs of its projectors. The first monthly volume of the new series may
fairly be said to be aflush with the finest promise. Mr. Andrew Lang's
'<span class="smcap">Essays in Little</span>' is one of the most entertaining and bracing of books. Full
of bright and engaging discourse, these charming and recreative essays are
the best of good reading. Hard must be 'the cynic's lips' from which Mr.
Lang's sportive pen does not 'dislodge the sneer,' harder that 'brow of care'
whose wrinkles refuse to be smoothed by Mr. Lang's gentle sarcasms and
agreeable raillery.... '<span class="smcap">Essays in Little</span>' ought to win every vote, and please
every class of reader."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"The volume is delightful, and exhibits Mr. Lang's light and dexterous
touch, his broad literary sympathies, and his sound critical instinct to great
advantage."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"'The Whitefriars Library' has begun well. Its first issue is a volume by
Mr. Andrew Lang, entitled '<span class="smcap">Essays in Little</span>.' Mr. Lang is here at his best&mdash;alike
in his most serious and his lightest moods. We find him turning
without effort, and with equal success, from 'Homer and the Study of Greek,'
to 'The Last Fashionable Novel'&mdash;on one page attacking grimly the modern
newspaper tendency to tittle-tattle (in a 'Letter to a Young Journalist'), on
another devising a bright parody in prose or verse. Mr. Lang is in his most
rollicking vein when treating of the once popular Haynes Bayly, the author of
'I'd be a Butterfly' and things of that sort. With Bayly's twaddling verse
Mr. Lang is in satiric ecstasies; he revels in its unconscious inanity, and
burlesques it repeatedly with infinite gusto.... His tone is always urbane,
his manner always bright and engaging. No one nowadays has a style at
once so light and so well bred.... It is always pleasant, and frequently
delightful."&mdash;<i>Globe</i></small>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>BY CLIVE HOLLAND></i></p>

<p class="center"><b><big>RAYMI; or, Children of the Sun.</big></b></p>

<p class="center">By the author of "The Golden Hawk." Crown 8vo, tastefully
bound, 5s. Illustrated.</p>


<p><small>"Of all the writers who may be described as belonging to the school of
Rider Haggard, Mr. Clive Holland is the most original and the most successful.
His 'Raymi' would do no discredit to Mr. Haggard himself. There is
room for improvement in the style, but that will come with use. What is of
more importance in a new (and presumably young) writer is that he should
have the root of the matter in him; and in all the essentials for a good story&mdash;character,
'go,' and incidents&mdash;Mr. Holland manifests great facility. Hugh
Carton, the hero, is put through some sad and dramatic experiences, and
not the least enthralling of these is his encounter with Richard Savill, the
buccaneer. It is under the most extraordinary circumstances that Hugh makes
his acquaintance. Savill is vigorously drawn, so that one is able to realise the
man as he was in his habit. Another part of the volume which contains several
graphic passages is that devoted to a description of the Children of the Sun,
with their rites and customs. Mr. Holland has written a previous romance,
with which we are not acquainted, but his present venture certainly warrants
the expectation of good work from him in the future."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"This is a good story&mdash;a mixture of the real and the romantic. Both
elements are well worked out: the real is so like to Nature, that we are ready
to think that the marvellous is not so very remote from it."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></small></p>

<p class="center"><b><big>GLORIANA; or, The Revolution of 1900.</big></b></p>

<p class="center">With Portrait. Crown 8vo, 6s.</p>

<p><small>"There is abundant play of fancy in the book, as well as some of the ordinary
elements of romance."&mdash;<i>Queen.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"A good many of the characters have a touch of individuality; and in a
literary point of view this book is more carefully written and is more interesting
than any of our author's previous works."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"A prose Revolt of Islam."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"It is a book that cannot fail to interest any one who takes it up; and to any
one who thinks at all it will, as it has done for us, afford a good deal to think
about. It is full of exciting incidents and adventures closely drawn from
life."&mdash;<i>St. Stephen's Review.</i></small></p>

<p><small>"Giving the clever and accomplished novelist all credit for earnestness of
purpose, it is scarcely possible to accept wholly the form in which she has
urged and illustrated her views; still we must respect and admire the talent
with which she pleads the cause she has so much at heart.... The tale is
well written, vigorous, and interesting."&mdash;<i>Life.</i></small></p>

Hamlet, Blanchard as the King, Liston as Ophelia, and Mrs. Liston
as the Queen. It was revived in 1874 on one occasion with Mr. Odell

supposed to have revised the last act of "Hamlet" in accordance with
modern notions. Polonius is alive, having been only wounded by
Hamlet; Hamlet's father also is alive, having only pretended to be dead.
At the close, the King, Queen, Laertes, and Ophelia, all come to life
again. Hamlet is represented by a stuffed figure, the actor chosen for
the part having refused to enact it.</p></div>
